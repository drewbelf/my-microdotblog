The difference is the left is less concerned with formal freedom (the concern of the right) than it is with substantive freedom.\n\nThis is one piece of Graeber & Wengrow's work that I really appreciate. They repeatedly stress that American indigenous peoples had a worldview closer to the contemporary US than European Enlightenment thinkers, because American indigenous peoples were concerned with (substantive) freedom. It's a clever rhetorical move: both the original inhabitants of the American continents and the present inhabitants of the American continents are interested in freedom; the difference is, in what that freedom consists.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Holy Week of any year&mdash;that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb—always has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.</p>\n<p>I was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly—weekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.</p>\n<p>Laurel Marshall Potter—colleague, friend, housemate—and I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community—Jews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals—gathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opening-prayer\">opening prayer</h2>\n<p>The way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God’s love. It is not God’s will that this injustice persist; it is not God’s will that the powerful remain so; it is not God’s will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus’s long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice. This God walks the way of death in solidarity with all who suffer, as one who suffers, that they might suffer no more. The way ends on the cross in death—and by that very death, so ends death itself.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>\n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-first-station-jesus-is-condemned-to-death\">the first station. Jesus is condemned to death</h2>\n<p>Coronavirus has exposed what the poorest and most vulnerable among us have long known—ours is a culture of death. Eager for profits, for consumer goods, for power, our culture readily sacrifices its poor, its elderly, its vulnerable to the market. Jesus, like many today, is a victim of this culture: as religious authorities and the crowd looked on, he was condemned to death lest empire lose its grip on its colonial possession. Pilate thought he could exempt himself from this culture of death; he thought he could wash his hands of the violence. Little did he know his complicity in death is his responsibility for death.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>\n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-second-station-jesus-carries-his-cross\">the second station. Jesus carries his cross.</h2>\n<p>The poor and marginalized disproportionately carry the burden of the culture of death. Black and brown bodies, women, queer people, people who are immunocompromised, ill and disabled, prisoners, the elderly, and the abused all bear the weight of structures that uphold kingdoms of death.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>\n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-third-station-jesus-falls-for-the-first-time\">the third station. Jesus falls for the first time.</h2>\n<p>Under the weight of the cross, that symbol of death’s reign, Jesus stumbles. His stumble is that of the economic poor, then and now—those who subsist on inadequate wages, who do not have access to affordable healthcare or housing or proper nourishment.

Worry, anxiety, fear, depression—these and other demons torment us. When we are responsible for the well-being of others, our mental health is only further strained.

Jesus’s third fall is perhaps the most crushing: it is in this moment that he realizes how alone he is. He has found small comforts along the way—the tears of his mother, the strength of Simon, the cloth of Veronica—but from here on out he is desperately alone. Our culture of death is a culture of isolation, for everyone dies alone. In that isolation is a spiritual desolation; apart from the fabric of our society, what meaning can our lives have?

				"content_text": "Holy Week of any year---that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb—always has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.\n\nI was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly—weekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.\n\nLaurel Marshall Potter—colleague, friend, housemate—and I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community—Jews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals—gathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.\n\n## opening prayer\nThe way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God’s love. It is not God’s will that this injustice persist; it is not God’s will that the powerful remain so; it is not God’s will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus’s long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice. This God walks the way of death in solidarity with all who suffer, as one who suffers, that they might suffer no more. The way ends on the cross in death—and by that very death, so ends death itself.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the first station. Jesus is condemned to death\nCoronavirus has exposed what the poorest and most vulnerable among us have long known—ours is a culture of death. Eager for profits, for consumer goods, for power, our culture readily sacrifices its poor, its elderly, its vulnerable to the market. Jesus, like many today, is a victim of this culture: as religious authorities and the crowd looked on, he was condemned to death lest empire lose its grip on its colonial possession. Pilate thought he could exempt himself from this culture of death; he thought he could wash his hands of the violence. Little did he know his complicity in death is his responsibility for death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the second station. Jesus carries his cross.\nThe poor and marginalized disproportionately carry the burden of the culture of death. Black and brown bodies, women, queer people, people who are immunocompromised, ill and disabled, prisoners, the elderly, and the abused all bear the weight of structures that uphold kingdoms of death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the third station. Jesus falls for the first time.\nUnder the weight of the cross, that symbol of death’s reign, Jesus stumbles. His stumble is that of the economic poor, then and now—those who subsist on inadequate wages, who do not have access to affordable healthcare or housing or proper nourishment. The weight is unbearable; he is brought to his knees, and not for the last time. His journey is only just beginning—how, under the weight of poverty and homelessness and material instability, can it be borne?\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the fourth station. Jesus meets his mother, Mary.\nHow acute Mary’s own pain when she sees the suffering of her child! When we love our family, chosen and given, we open ourselves up the pain of their suffering. Our relationships make us vulnerable, and they also make us human. Mary is not absent from Jesus’s crucifixion, even though it is painful, hopeless, maddening.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the fifth station. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross\n**Cuando el pobre crea en la pobre**  \n**Ya podremos cantar libertad**  \n**Cuando la/el pobre crea en el/la pobre,**  \n**Construiremos la fraternidad**  \n\nCuando el pobre busca al pobre  \ny nace la organización  \nes que empieza nuestra liberación.  \nCuando el pobre anuncia al pobre  \nla esperanza que Él nos dio,  \nYa su Reino entre nosotros nació.  \n\n**Coro**\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the sixth station. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus.\nKind gestures are not worthless. Though much more is needed to interrupt the crucifixions that surround us, we cannot deem small kindnesses unimportant. Veronica knows she cannot stop the parade of death, but she risks drawing near to Jesus to offer a fleeting moment of relief. Immediate, compassionate relief must be part of our response to the culture of death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the seventh station. Jesus falls for the second time.\nAgain, death’s weight is too much—Jesus falls. He fears for himself, certainly, but he fears for his family, his disciples, his people. Jesus is not free of the anxiety of death; neither are we. Especially in times of uncertainty as our physical health is at risk, so too is our mental health. Worry, anxiety, fear, depression—these and other demons torment us. When we are responsible for the well-being of others, our mental health is only further strained. We feel we can hardly bear it.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟.

The isolation of coronavirus is a symptom of a deeper sickness: a culture that does not allow us community and solidarity.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the tenth station. Jesus is stripped of his clothes.\n>“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—  \nBecause I was not a socialist.  \nThen they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—  \nBecause I was not a trade unionist.  \nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—  \nBecause I was not a Jew.  \nThen they came for me—  \nand there was no one left to speak for me.”\n\nHaving robbed us of our solidarity, the culture of death, when it comes for us, strips us of all pretense of security, of control, and of belonging.

				"title": "Of baptism",
				"content_html": "<p>Dear C—,<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>This past Sunday, on a cool and bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism—something in which you had no say and of which you have no memory—creeping into your life in strange and unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all. I write this note in the hope it can offer some guidance here. Given the subject matter, this note is woefully short (despite its length!), but I hope it&rsquo;s helpful even still.</p>\n<p>The joys of life are many, and you&rsquo;ll come to learn these in time—riding a bike without training wheels, enjoying a meal you helped to prepare, reading a book your mom loved when she was your age. But when you have enjoyed all life has to offer and when you come to the end of your time on earth, there life&rsquo;s final obligation imposes itself. If you&rsquo;ll allow me to be blunt: all living things—human beings, animals, plants—must die. Even nonliving things tend toward decay—given enough time, rocks break down into sand, stars explode into stardust, houses fall apart. This is an unfortunate, tragic, unsettling fact, but a fact nonetheless.</p>\n<p>But it is exactly because of this burden of death that your parents had you baptized. Baptism, you see, is a remedy to the death into which all living things are born. When you were baptized, water was poured over your head three times. This ritual symbolically—though as Catholics we really ought to say &ldquo;sacramentally&rdquo;—puts the person being baptized to death; when she is lifted out of the baptismal font, she is raised to new life and made a member of the community founded by Christ and made up of all the baptized. This community—which we call &ldquo;the church&rdquo;—is freed by baptism from the reign of death and liberated into a reign of life. The freedom of the Christian is a freedom to live in and by the love of God—a love that is totally selfless and pure, concerned never for itself but always for the other.</p>\n<p>But just as being born naturally imposed upon you an obligation of death, so does being reborn sacramentally impose upon you an obligation. And as you would expect, the obligation baptism imposes is exactly the opposite of the one imposed by being born: the baptized are obliged to live!</p>\n<p>Christians have a peculiar understanding of what it is to live; peculiar, at least, according to how the rest of the world tends to think of what it is to live. For Christians to live, they must live for others—they must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger, visit the imprisoned. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapter 25 of Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel</a>; or the Sermon on the Mount, found in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapters 5–7 of the same Gospel</a>.) And very often, Christians must inconvenience themselves to live in this way—they must feed the hungry with their own food, clothe the naked with their own clothing, take the stranger into their own home, and visit the imprisoned on their own time. (St. Basil the Great says the unworn jacket in your closet rightfully belongs to the poor person who has no jacket!<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>) In this way, the life you received in your baptism is not so much yours as it is others', especially those most in need of your help.</p>\n<p>This obligation to live liberates us from the relentless rhythm of decay, that dirge of death according to which the rest of the world marches. Yet that baptismal obligation is not always pleasant—as I&rsquo;ve just suggested, it involves a personal cost to the Christian. You may find yourself with less food than you might otherwise have because you&rsquo;ve given some to your hungry neighbor, for example. What&rsquo;s more, you may find the task itself unpleasant. The hungry might lack table manners, or the poor decorum; the stranger&rsquo;s unusual customs might confuse you, and the prisoner&rsquo;s past might frighten. (<a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul\">St. Vincent de Paul has some really lovely words on this</a>; I remain forever haunted by his claim: &ldquo;It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.&rdquo; I have tears in my eyes as I recall my own failings in this respect.)</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another reason why we might shy away from baptism&rsquo;s obligation (and many, regrettably, do). The obligation of baptism to live runs directly contrary to the world and its designs. Unlike the white garment of life that the baptized wear, the world wears a death shroud and, wittingly or not, the world seeks to shroud more of the living in death. There&rsquo;s a reason, after all, that there are people without enough food, or too poor for clothing or a home, or lacking the freedom you enjoy. For the Christian to live her life for others, then, and for her to spread life in a world of death, is a subversive, even dangerous, undertaking. Indeed, the Christian seeks nothing less than liberation for all those bound by chains of death: liberation from hunger and poverty, and, yes, from the literal chains of the prison yard. The Christian seeks to undo, once and for all, the pattern of death in the world. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A47-55&amp;version=RSVCE\">Mary&rsquo;s Magnificat toward the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke</a>.)</p>\n<p>This is the sort of subversive, dangerous trouble Jesus got himself into. He came into a world of death preaching a message of life and love; he rejected the status quo and sought to undo the patterns of death that keep all, oppressors and oppressed alike, in chains. But the powers that be would not stand for it; they dealt with the problem in the only way they knew how, and they had him killed. Ironically, it was this very act of violence against life that assured the final victory of life over death (but that&rsquo;s another email for another time; in the meantime, you might take a look at <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A35-58&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapter 15 of Paul&rsquo;s First Letter to the Corinthians, especially verses 35 and following</a>).</p>\n<p>The life that your baptism demands of you is subversive: for this reason, the world may try to stop you, as it did Jesus. There will be some who take advantage of your generosity; there will be some who ridicule you for what they take to be foolishness on your part; there may even be some who commit acts of violence against you, so desperate will they be to stop the liberation you bring. I hope this is not the case for you; but I also hope that you take the demands of your baptism seriously, and that you live the life you have been freed to live. St. Irenaeus, one of the first theologians in the church&rsquo;s history, said that the glory of God is the human being fully alive. I hope you glorify God in all that you do by rejecting death and choosing to be fully alive for the liberation of yourself and of all.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you find yourself inspired by the liberating power of your baptism; perhaps you find yourself daunted at the prospect of such a demanding life; perhaps you find yourself vaguely annoyed at having spent so much time reading all this nonsense!

However you respond to this—whether positively, negatively, or even indifferently—I hope you know there are people in your life who will always be available to talk to you about this.

				"content_text": "Dear C—,[^1]\n\nThis past Sunday, on a cool and bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism—something in which you had no say and of which you have no memory—creeping into your life in strange and unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all. I write this note in the hope it can offer some guidance here. Given the subject matter, this note is woefully short (despite its length!), but I hope it's helpful even still.\n\nThe joys of life are many, and you'll come to learn these in time—riding a bike without training wheels, enjoying a meal you helped to prepare, reading a book your mom loved when she was your age. But when you have enjoyed all life has to offer and when you come to the end of your time on earth, there life's final obligation imposes itself. If you'll allow me to be blunt: all living things—human beings, animals, plants—must die. Even nonliving things tend toward decay—given enough time, rocks break down into sand, stars explode into stardust, houses fall apart. This is an unfortunate, tragic, unsettling fact, but a fact nonetheless.\n\nBut it is exactly because of this burden of death that your parents had you baptized. Baptism, you see, is a remedy to the death into which all living things are born. When you were baptized, water was poured over your head three times. This ritual symbolically—though as Catholics we really ought to say \"sacramentally\"—puts the person being baptized to death; when she is lifted out of the baptismal font, she is raised to new life and made a member of the community founded by Christ and made up of all the baptized. This community—which we call \"the church\"—is freed by baptism from the reign of death and liberated into a reign of life. The freedom of the Christian is a freedom to live in and by the love of God—a love that is totally selfless and pure, concerned never for itself but always for the other.\n\nBut just as being born naturally imposed upon you an obligation of death, so does being reborn sacramentally impose upon you an obligation. And as you would expect, the obligation baptism imposes is exactly the opposite of the one imposed by being born: the baptized are obliged to live!\n\nChristians have a peculiar understanding of what it is to live; peculiar, at least, according to how the rest of the world tends to think of what it is to live. For Christians to live, they must live for others—they must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger, visit the imprisoned. (For more on this, see [chapter 25 of Matthew's Gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&version=RSVCE); or the Sermon on the Mount, found in [chapters 5–7 of the same Gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&version=RSVCE).) And very often, Christians must inconvenience themselves to live in this way—they must feed the hungry with their own food, clothe the naked with their own clothing, take the stranger into their own home, and visit the imprisoned on their own time. (St. Basil the Great says the unworn jacket in your closet rightfully belongs to the poor person who has no jacket![^2]) In this way, the life you received in your baptism is not so much yours as it is others', especially those most in need of your help.\n\nThis obligation to live liberates us from the relentless rhythm of decay, that dirge of death according to which the rest of the world marches. Yet that baptismal obligation is not always pleasant—as I've just suggested, it involves a personal cost to the Christian. You may find yourself with less food than you might otherwise have because you've given some to your hungry neighbor, for example. What's more, you may find the task itself unpleasant. The hungry might lack table manners, or the poor decorum; the stranger's unusual customs might confuse you, and the prisoner's past might frighten. ([St. Vincent de Paul has some really lovely words on this](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul); I remain forever haunted by his claim: \"It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.\" I have tears in my eyes as I recall my own failings in this respect.)\n\nThere's another reason why we might shy away from baptism's obligation (and many, regrettably, do). The obligation of baptism to live runs directly contrary to the world and its designs. Unlike the white garment of life that the baptized wear, the world wears a death shroud and, wittingly or not, the world seeks to shroud more of the living in death. There's a reason, after all, that there are people without enough food, or too poor for clothing or a home, or lacking the freedom you enjoy.

(For more on this, see [Mary's Magnificat toward the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A47-55&version=RSVCE).)\n\nThis is the sort of subversive, dangerous trouble Jesus got himself into. He came into a world of death preaching a message of life and love; he rejected the status quo and sought to undo the patterns of death that keep all, oppressors and oppressed alike, in chains. But the powers that be would not stand for it; they dealt with the problem in the only way they knew how, and they had him killed.

There will be some who take advantage of your generosity; there will be some who ridicule you for what they take to be foolishness on your part; there may even be some who commit acts of violence against you, so desperate will they be to stop the liberation you bring.
