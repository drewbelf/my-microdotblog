But before leaving them, one name must be mentioned which represents the climax of the developments we have been discussing: the name of St. Francis. The period of his public career from 1209 to 1226 lies outside the scope of this book, but he is the embodiment of the spirit of Christian romance which we have watched in some aspects of its development from the time of St. Anselm. The inward quest of St. Anselm or St. Bernard---faith seeking understand, or carnal love seeking its spiritual object---was given an external symbolism in the homeless, wandering, unsheltered life of the beggar. The most negative & drabbest of the monastic virtues---Poverty---was transformed Cinderella-like into a fairy princess, & invested with the fascinating qualities of a romantic heroine. Above all, the tender, passionate love of Jesus had its earthly consummation in the vision of the Crucified & the crisis of the stigmata on Monte Alverna in 1224. With St. Francis & his followers, the fruits of the experiences of St. Anselm & St. Bernard were brought to the market place, & became the common property of the lay & clerical world alike.\n",

Do you have anxiety, or difficulty making decisions? Do you find yourself unable to decide whether you should use that or which when composing a sentence? In the event that you answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to either of the first two questions you have our sympathies, but as a dictionary we can offer little else. However, if the source of your trouble is the issue of that and which we may be of some small assistance.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Herbert McCabe on the Trinity (from &ldquo;A Sermon for Pentecost&rdquo; in <em>God Still Matters</em>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God understands, contemplates, his divine life. We can think of God as forming a concept of himself (we don&rsquo;t have to, but we can); we can think of God&rsquo;s understanding as God&rsquo;s conceiving what it is to be God ‚Äì having an idea of the meaning of being God; God naming himself &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; We can think, as John may have done, of the concept or Word of God that was in the beginning with God, and was God; &lsquo;was God&rsquo; because it was the perfect, utterly adequate thought of God, no different from God. So the revelation of the Word made flesh is God&rsquo;s own idea of himself dwelling amongst us, God&rsquo;s word to himself becoming his word to us.</p>\n<p>And then we can think (we don&rsquo;t have to but we can) of the joy that God takes in contemplating his life, his divinity, in the Word ‚Äì that profound acquiescence in being divine: the immense joy of the eternal God, not now in what he has created or done, but in what he is just in living, in being God. God knows his life and, in knowing it, loves it. Or: in eternity, the Father, contemplating his divine life, brings forth the Word, and through the Word gives forth Joy, the Spirit. So, as a reflection of this eternal life, in history, the father sends to us the Word made flesh, Jesus, and through the Word made flesh, gives forth to us the Joy of the Spirit, to make the Church.

				"content_text": "Herbert McCabe on the Trinity (from \"A Sermon for Pentecost\" in *God Still Matters*):\n\n> God understands, contemplates, his divine life. We can think of God as forming a concept of himself (we don't have to, but we can); we can think of God's understanding as God's conceiving what it is to be God ‚Äì having an idea of the meaning of being God; God naming himself 'I am.' We can think, as John may have done, of the concept or Word of God that was in the beginning with God, and was God; 'was God' because it was the perfect, utterly adequate thought of God, no different from God. So the revelation of the Word made flesh is God's own idea of himself dwelling amongst us, God's word to himself becoming his word to us.\n> \n> And then we can think (we don't have to but we can) of the joy that God takes in contemplating his life, his divinity, in the Word ‚Äì that profound acquiescence in being divine: the immense joy of the eternal God, not now in what he has created or done, but in what he is just in living, in being God. God knows his life and, in knowing it, loves it. Or: in eternity, the Father, contemplating his divine life, brings forth the Word, and through the Word gives forth Joy, the Spirit. So, as a reflection of this eternal life, in history, the father sends to us the Word made flesh, Jesus, and through the Word made flesh, gives forth to us the Joy of the Spirit, to make the Church.
