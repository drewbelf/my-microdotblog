The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird &amp; funny, &amp; Ryan Gosling &amp; Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances&mdash;Gosling&rsquo;s wonderfully funny, &amp; Robbie&rsquo;s wonderfully subtle.

Still, it is buoyed by several strong performances (chief among them Cillian Murphy &amp; Robert Downey, Jr.) &amp; visually &amp; aurally stunning sequences. The nonlinear storytelling, while a staple for Nolan, I think did more to detract from than add to the film&mdash;though it did allow for an extremely powerful final scene. (I don&rsquo;t want to say much more than that, for folks who haven&rsquo;t seen it.) Especially now that I have a better sense of the plot in mind, I&rsquo;ll have to see it strikes me on a second viewing.

The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird & funny, & Ryan Gosling & Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances---Gosling's wonderfully funny, & Robbie's wonderfully subtle. Greta Gerwig adds another film to [her already impressive](https://youtu.be/cNi_HC839Wo) [body of work](https://youtu.be/uoq3Ro4iGls) in this sensitive & delightful reflection on the human project of making meaning in the face of uncertainty & death.\n\nThat this is, apparently, only [the first of Mattel's own cinematic universe](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/after-barbie-mattel-is-raiding-its-entire-toybox) makes me more than a little queasy---& takes some of the bite out *Barbie*'s jokes at Mattel's expsnse---but I really, really enjoyed *Barbie* all the same.\n\nI'm still thinking about *Oppenheimer*. Like much of Nolan's work it's grand & ambitious, but I worry it stumbles a bit under its own weight. Still, it is buoyed by several strong performances (chief among them Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey, Jr.) & visually & aurally stunning sequences. The nonlinear storytelling, while a staple for Nolan, I think did more to detract from than add to the film---though it did allow for an extremely powerful final scene. (I don't want to say much more than that, for folks who haven't seen it.) Especially now that I have a better sense of the plot in mind, I'll have to see it strikes me on a second viewing. I wasn't quite disappointed or letdown by the film, but neither did it quite have the impact I was anticipating.\n",

				"title": "On teaching Francis \u0026 Clare",
				"content_html": "<p>How to teach a course on Francis &amp; Clare of Assisi?<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission &amp; values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives &amp; writings of Francis &amp; Clare.</p>\n<p>Teaching such a course is not without its challenges. The twenty-first century United States seems worlds apart from thirteenth-century Italy, &amp; we cannot understand Francis &amp; Clare without understanding their world. Francis &amp; Clare are themselves very strange people—strange not only for their preference of poverty to riches &amp; asceticism to comfort, but also for their reasons for those preferences. &amp; given the gap that yawns between our day &amp; theirs, it’s not always immediately clear why people today should care about this pair of strange medieval Christians.</p>\n<p>Or, so it would seem. While I do want my teaching to preserve the strangeness of Francis &amp; Clare, lest we domesticate them to the Francis of the birdbath, their lives &amp; situations are not always so remote from our own. Allow me to describe, in broad strokes, my approach in teaching “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” The course, &amp; my remarks today, unfold across three movements. First, we must pay attention to Francis &amp; Clare’s own context; second, we must pay attention to Francis &amp; Clare’s words &amp; deeds; third, we must pay attention to our own context, words, &amp; deeds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-first-pay-attention-to-francis--clares-own-context\">We first pay attention to Francis &amp; Clare’s own context.</h2>\n<p>We have to begin with the world into which Francis &amp; Clare were born. That world includes some theological ideas that medieval Christians took for granted &amp; that find peculiar expression in Francis &amp; Clare’s lives &amp; writings: ideas like creation, sin, the kingdom of God, <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19%3A16-26&amp;version=NRSVCE\">the incompatibility of living for God &amp; living for money</a>, the redeeming suffering &amp; death of Jesus, martyrdom &amp; monasticism. But Francis &amp; Clare’s world was not just religious but also economic, social, &amp; cultural, &amp; these factors played as much a role in shaping Francis &amp; Clare as did their religion.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> They witnessed a growing disparity in wealth between the haves &amp; have-nots; they lived through rapid urbanization &amp; a spiritual crisis brought about by this new form of isolated living; they were grieved at the marginalization of the sick &amp; the poor from community life.</p>\n<p>Only with some sense of this context can we begin to understand the meaning of Francis &amp; Clare’s words &amp; gestures. In setting this context, too, students can begin to draw connections between Francis &amp; Clare’s world &amp; our own. Wealth &amp; income inequality are not, after all, unfamiliar phenomena to us today; neither is social isolation brought about by new technologies &amp; societal circumstances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"second-we-pay-attention-to-francis--clares-own-words--deeds\">Second, we pay attention to Francis &amp; Clare’s own words &amp; deeds,</h2>\n<p>especially how these words &amp; deeds respond to their particular historical &amp; cultural moment. We begin by looking at ‘penance’, for this is the decisive impulse of Francis’s life. <a href=\"https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-testament/140-fa-ed-1-page-124\">As he reflects on his life in his <em>Testament</em> Francis narrates his own religious conversion</a> with these words: “The Lord gave me, Brother Francis, thus to begin doing penance in this way: for when I was in sin, it seemed too bitter for me to see those suffering leprosy. &amp; the Lord himself led me among them, &amp; I showed mercy to them.” This penitential orientation, which entails rejecting whatever alienates &amp; dehumanizes the human fraternity &amp; instead practicing compassion &amp; mercy for all God’s creatures, is the defining feature of Francis’s outlook &amp; behavior.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> Here the benefit of knowing Francis’s context begins to show forth: without understanding how Assisi stigmatized &amp; marginalized those with leprosy, it is impossible to understand with any depth the significance of Francis’s life of penance.</p>\n<p>Poverty is another major theme in this part of the course; here again contextualizing Francis &amp; Clare helps illuminate this supremely countercultural practice.<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> Francis &amp; Clare refuse to handle money not just out of gospel fidelity or trust in God, but as a gesture responding directly to the violence wrought by an emerging money economy.<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">5</a></sup> Their embrace of poverty is something of a protest: against the ascendancy of the transactional over the personal in human relationship, &amp; against the evaluation of persons (or, more distressingly for Francis &amp; Clare, the de-valuation of persons) based on economic status.<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>We consider other themes in Francis &amp; Clare’s lives &amp; writings, too—fraternal living &amp; universal kinship,<sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">7</a></sup> peacemaking,<sup id=\"fnref:8\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">8</a></sup> prayer &amp; contemplation,<sup id=\"fnref:9\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">9</a></sup> to name a few. Students particularly enjoy discussing how Francis &amp; Clare each navigate church authorities, in often unexpectedly subversive ways.<sup id=\"fnref:10\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">10</a></sup></p>\n<h2 id=\"third-we-pay-attention-to-our-own-context-words--deeds\">Third, we pay attention to our own context, words, &amp; deeds.</h2>\n<p>The hope here is that students will read the “signs of the times,” as it were, in light of the lives &amp; values of Francis &amp; Clare. My sections of “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare” tend to focus on the moral &amp; spiritual challenge posed by climate change; I have found this issue is rarely far from students’ minds, &amp; Francis &amp; Clare offer some particularly apt resources to engage this issue.</p>\n<p>Consider, for example, ideas of fraternity &amp; kinship. What obligations do we humans have to the natural world, if <a href=\"https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-canticle-of-the-creatures/129-fa-ed-1-page-113\">nonhuman creatures are sister &amp; brother to us as Francis sang</a>? How have humans failed in that obligation, particularly in the wake of the industrial revolution &amp; the widespread environmental degradation of our day? If God is praised through all God’s creatures, what does the loss of biodiversity mean for creation’s capacity to reflect the depths of God’s goodness &amp; beauty? How should human beings who enjoy some degree of privilege respond with mercy &amp; compassion to <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\">the cry of the earth &amp; the cry of the poor</a>? We ask these &amp; related questions in light of our study of Francis &amp; Clare.</p>\n<p>The goal of “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare” is not just to know a little bit about the personalities behind the mission &amp; values of SBU; the goal is also to consider how Francis &amp; Clare continue to speak to people of good will today, urging us to patterns of life that prefer mercy to cruelty, compassion to apathy, generosity to wealth, justice to oppression.

				"content_text": "How to teach a course on Francis & Clare of Assisi?[^*] The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology & Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled “The Way of Francis & Clare.” This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission & values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives & writings of Francis & Clare.\n\n[^*]: These remarks were delivered at the 2023 Association of Franciscan Colleges & Universities Symposium, on a panel titled [Illuminating Franciscan Sources in the Classroom: Francis, Clare, & Beyond](https://afcu2023.siena.edu/session/illuminating-franciscan-sources-in-the-classroom-francis-clare-and-beyond/).\n\nTeaching such a course is not without its challenges. The twenty-first century United States seems worlds apart from thirteenth-century Italy, & we cannot understand Francis & Clare without understanding their world. Francis & Clare are themselves very strange people—strange not only for their preference of poverty to riches & asceticism to comfort, but also for their reasons for those preferences. & given the gap that yawns between our day & theirs, it’s not always immediately clear why people today should care about this pair of strange medieval Christians.\n\nOr, so it would seem. While I do want my teaching to preserve the strangeness of Francis & Clare, lest we domesticate them to the Francis of the birdbath, their lives & situations are not always so remote from our own. Allow me to describe, in broad strokes, my approach in teaching “The Way of Francis & Clare.” The course, & my remarks today, unfold across three movements. First, we must pay attention to Francis & Clare’s own context; second, we must pay attention to Francis & Clare’s words & deeds; third, we must pay attention to our own context, words, & deeds.\n\n## We first pay attention to Francis & Clare’s own context.\n\nWe have to begin with the world into which Francis & Clare were born. That world includes some theological ideas that medieval Christians took for granted & that find peculiar expression in Francis & Clare’s lives & writings: ideas like creation, sin, the kingdom of God, [the incompatibility of living for God & living for money](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19%3A16-26&version=NRSVCE), the redeeming suffering & death of Jesus, martyrdom & monasticism. But Francis & Clare’s world was not just religious but also economic, social, & cultural, & these factors played as much a role in shaping Francis & Clare as did their religion.[^2] They witnessed a growing disparity in wealth between the haves & have-nots; they lived through rapid urbanization & a spiritual crisis brought about by this new form of isolated living; they were grieved at the marginalization of the sick & the poor from community life.\n\n[^2]: Dominic Monti, ofm, offers a helpful overview of these factors in his *Francis & His Brothers: A Popular History of the Franciscan Friars* (St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2009).\n\nOnly with some sense of this context can we begin to understand the meaning of Francis & Clare’s words & gestures. In setting this context, too, students can begin to draw connections between Francis & Clare’s world & our own. Wealth & income inequality are not, after all, unfamiliar phenomena to us today; neither is social isolation brought about by new technologies & societal circumstances.\n\n## Second, we pay attention to Francis & Clare’s own words & deeds,\n\nespecially how these words & deeds respond to their particular historical & cultural moment. We begin by looking at ‘penance’, for this is the decisive impulse of Francis’s life. [As he reflects on his life in his *Testament* Francis narrates his own religious conversion](https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-testament/140-fa-ed-1-page-124) with these words: “The Lord gave me, Brother Francis, thus to begin doing penance in this way: for when I was in sin, it seemed too bitter for me to see those suffering leprosy. & the Lord himself led me among them, & I showed mercy to them.” This penitential orientation, which entails rejecting whatever alienates & dehumanizes the human fraternity & instead practicing compassion & mercy for all God’s creatures, is the defining feature of Francis’s outlook & behavior.[^3] Here the benefit of knowing Francis’s context begins to show forth: without understanding how Assisi stigmatized & marginalized those with leprosy, it is impossible to understand with any depth the significance of Francis’s life of penance.\n\n[^3]: On Francis's understanding of penance, see Michael F. Cusato, ofm, “To Do Penance / *Facere Poenitentiam*,” *The Cord* 57, no. 1 (2007): 3–24.\n\nPoverty is another major theme in this part of the course; here again contextualizing Francis & Clare helps illuminate this supremely countercultural practice.[^3a] Francis & Clare refuse to handle money not just out of gospel fidelity or trust in God, but as a gesture responding directly to the violence wrought by an emerging money economy.[^4] Their embrace of poverty is something of a protest: against the ascendancy of the transactional over the personal in human relationship, & against the evaluation of persons (or, more distressingly for Francis & Clare, the de-valuation of persons) based on economic status.[^5]\n\n[^3a]: William Short, ofm, in his *Poverty & Joy: The Franciscan Tradition* (Orbis Books, 1999) helps explain Francis's practice of poverty & Clare's role as the \"first interpreter\" of Francis. This book is a helpful resource also because it considers not only Francis & Clare as founders of the Franciscan tradition but also as that tradition is received in subsequent generations of Franciscans.\n\n[^4]: David Flood, ofm, helps explain some features of this money economy & how it was used to oppress and further impoverish the already impoverished in “Franciscans and Money,” *Haversack* 4, no. 2 (1980): 12–21.\n\n[^5]: See again Cusato, \"To Do Penance,\" 13–15, 16–18.\n\nWe consider other themes in Francis & Clare’s lives & writings, too—fraternal living & universal kinship,[^6] peacemaking,[^7] prayer & contemplation,[^8] to name a few. Students particularly enjoy discussing how Francis & Clare each navigate church authorities, in often unexpectedly subversive ways.[^9]\n\n[^6]: See Marie Dennis, et al., *St. Francis and the Foolishness of God* (Orbis Books, 2015), 39–59; & André Vauchez, \"Francis, Nature, and the World,\" in *Francis of Assisi: The Life and Afterlife of a Medieval Saint* (translated by Michael Cusato; Yale University Press, 2012).\n\n[^7]: Steven J. McMichael, ofm, “Francis and the Encounter with the Sultan (1219),” in *The Cambridge Companion to Francis of Assisi*, ed. Michael J. P. Robson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 127–42.\n\n[^8]: Short, *Poverty & Joy*, 81–92; & Dennis, et al., *St. Francis and the Foolishness of God*, 147–69.\n\n[^9]: Beth Lynn, osc, \"Clare of Assisi and Conscientious Objection,\" *The Cord* 48, no. 4 (1998): 191–200.\n\n## Third, we pay attention to our own context, words, & deeds.\n\nThe hope here is that students will read the “signs of the times,” as it were, in light of the lives & values of Francis & Clare. My sections of “The Way of Francis & Clare” tend to focus on the moral & spiritual challenge posed by climate change; I have found this issue is rarely far from students’ minds, & Francis & Clare offer some particularly apt resources to engage this issue.\n\nConsider, for example, ideas of fraternity & kinship. What obligations do we humans have to the natural world, if [nonhuman creatures are sister & brother to us as Francis sang](https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-canticle-of-the-creatures/129-fa-ed-1-page-113)? How have humans failed in that obligation, particularly in the wake of the industrial revolution & the widespread environmental degradation of our day? If God is praised through all God’s creatures, what does the loss of biodiversity mean for creation’s capacity to reflect the depths of God’s goodness & beauty? How should human beings who enjoy some degree of privilege respond with mercy & compassion to [the cry of the earth & the cry of the poor](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html)? We ask these & related questions in light of our study of Francis & Clare.\n\nThe goal of “The Way of Francis & Clare” is not just to know a little bit about the personalities behind the mission & values of SBU; the goal is also to consider how Francis & Clare continue to speak to people of good will today, urging us to patterns of life that prefer mercy to cruelty, compassion to apathy, generosity to wealth, justice to oppression. Whether they are heard today depends as much on the students as it does the instructor, but if we cannot hear Francis & Clare in their own day we certainly cannot hear them in ours.\n",

There is no need for egoism or worldly striving, for self-interest or status; there is no need to convince yourself that you are loved for your accomplishments or achievements. You are loved, even apart from all that. Resting in the assurance of God&rsquo;s love, then, one can stop trying to convince others (&amp; yourself) that you are lovable.

				"content_html": "<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/a-few-things-you-would-read-if-you\">Phil Christman&rsquo;s recent post of the same name</a>, here&rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what <em>I</em> get out of Christianity.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s Christman&rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It’s extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone’s. It reflects where I sit in a set of social structures. Either God came and met me there, despite the badness of those structures, or God didn’t, but if God did, this was how, or part of it. Either way, I make no apology. It’s my life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an effort to limit myself, I&rsquo;m going to try to copy Christman&rsquo;s basic form: he includes a literary classic, a work from a spiritual writer, an essay, &amp; a classic in Christian apologetics. I, not Christman, have identified these categories, &amp; I realize his list could have been categorized differently. But this keeps things manageable for me, at least for now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781250082244\"><em>Silence: A Novel</em>, by Shūsaku Endō</a>. What is it to be a Christian in the face of suffering, both your own &amp; another&rsquo;s? What is it to be a Christian when all you hear is God&rsquo;s silence? These are the questions that occupy this book. Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s film adaptation is excellent, too, though no substitute for the book. (Honestly, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780812974263\"><em>Les Misérables</em></a> probably better belongs in this category of &ldquo;literary classic&rdquo;&mdash;its treatment of themes of justice &amp; mercy in the personal &amp; social lives of Christians has had a deep effect on me, though I can hardly recommend a 650,000+ word novel on a list like this.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780307589521\"><em>Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</em>, by Thomas Merton</a>. Most anything by Thomas Merton could fit into this spot, but I&rsquo;ve chosen <em>Conjectures</em> because I think it shows how Merton weds the contemplative &amp; the active especially later in his life. He wanders a bit in this book &amp; that can make it difficult to follow where he&rsquo;s going, but it&rsquo;s nevertheless a rewarding read.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&ldquo;He Was Crucified, Suffered Death, and Was Buried&rdquo; (collected in <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780826461919\"><em>God Still Matters</em></a>) by Herbert McCabe. This essay, I think, best presents the pithy line <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching\">Terry Eagleton attributed</a> to McCabe: &ldquo;If you don’t love you’re dead, and if you do, they’ll kill you.&rdquo; (Come to think of it, that Eagleton essay could fit well into this slot, too.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781467459259\"><em>The Love That Is God: An Invitation to Christian Faith</em>, by Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt</a>. It may be a bit premature to call this one a classic&mdash;though it is very, very good, &amp; destined to be a classic according to Sarah Coakley&rsquo;s foreword&mdash;&amp; the book isn&rsquo;t exactly an apologetic, but it fits well enough into this category. Fritz&mdash;who, full disclosure, directed my master&rsquo;s thesis while I was a graduate student at Loyola University Maryland&mdash;has left an impression on me that goes deeper than I think he realizes. <em>The Love That Is God</em> basically summarizes what I would want anyone to know about Christianity, &amp; so I feel it belongs in this spot.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to&mdash;&amp; I think I will&mdash;revisit this list &amp; revise it in the future. (My <a href=\"https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/04/09/phil-christman-a.html\">initial post on this idea</a> names a few others writers whom I&rsquo;d like to include, especially Dorothy Day.) I might swap out certain entries, I might add more categories to consider, or I might overhaul it entirely. But that, at least for the moment, is what I&rsquo;d suggest you read if you want to figure out what I get out of Christianity.</p>\n",

Either God came and met me there, despite the badness of those structures, or God didn’t, but if God did, this was how, or part of it. Either way, I make no apology. It’s my life.\n\nIn an effort to limit myself, I'm going to try to copy Christman's basic form: he includes a literary classic, a work from a spiritual writer, an essay, & a classic in Christian apologetics. I, not Christman, have identified these categories, & I realize his list could have been categorized differently. But this keeps things manageable for me, at least for now.\n\n1. [*Silence: A Novel*, by Shūsaku Endō](https://micro.blog/books/9781250082244). What is it to be a Christian in the face of suffering, both your own & another's? What is it to be a Christian when all you hear is God's silence? These are the questions that occupy this book. Martin Scorsese's film adaptation is excellent, too, though no substitute for the book. (Honestly, [*Les Misérables*](https://micro.blog/books/9780812974263) probably better belongs in this category of \"literary classic\"---its treatment of themes of justice & mercy in the personal & social lives of Christians has had a deep effect on me, though I can hardly recommend a 650,000+ word novel on a list like this.)\n\n3. [*Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander*, by Thomas Merton](https://micro.blog/books/9780307589521). Most anything by Thomas Merton could fit into this spot, but I've chosen *Conjectures* because I think it shows how Merton weds the contemplative & the active especially later in his life. He wanders a bit in this book & that can make it difficult to follow where he's going, but it's nevertheless a rewarding read.\n\n5. \"He Was Crucified, Suffered Death, and Was Buried\" (collected in [*God Still Matters*](https://micro.blog/books/9780826461919)) by Herbert McCabe. This essay, I think, best presents the pithy line [Terry Eagleton attributed](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching) to McCabe: \"If you don’t love you’re dead, and if you do, they’ll kill you.\" (Come to think of it, that Eagleton essay could fit well into this slot, too.)\n6. [*The Love That Is God: An Invitation to Christian Faith*, by Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt](https://micro.blog/books/9781467459259). It may be a bit premature to call this one a classic---though it is very, very good, & destined to be a classic according to Sarah Coakley's foreword---& the book isn't exactly an apologetic, but it fits well enough into this category. Fritz---who, full disclosure, directed my master's thesis while I was a graduate student at Loyola University Maryland---has left an impression on me that goes deeper than I think he realizes. *The Love That Is God* basically summarizes what I would want anyone to know about Christianity, & so I feel it belongs in this spot.\n\nI'd like to---& I think I will---revisit this list & revise it in the future. (My [initial post on this idea](https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/04/09/phil-christman-a.html) names a few others writers whom I'd like to include, especially Dorothy Day.) I might swap out certain entries, I might add more categories to consider, or I might overhaul it entirely. But that, at least for the moment, is what I'd suggest you read if you want to figure out what I get out of Christianity.\n",

This is not far from the traditional doctrine of the Fathers of the Church concerning original sin! Note of course that the doctrine of original sin, properly understood, is <em>optimistic</em>. It does not teach that man is by nature evil, but that evil in him is unnatural, a disorder, a sin. If evil, lying, and hatred were natural to man, all men would be perfectly at home, perfectly happy in evil. Perhaps a few seem to find contentment in an unnatural state of falsity, hatred, and greed. They are not happy. Or if they are, they are unnatural.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

This is not far from the traditional doctrine of the Fathers of the Church concerning original sin! Note of course that the doctrine of original sin, properly understood, is *optimistic*. It does not teach that man is by nature evil, but that evil in him is unnatural, a disorder, a sin. If evil, lying, and hatred were natural to man, all men would be perfectly at home, perfectly happy in evil. Perhaps a few seem to find contentment in an unnatural state of falsity, hatred, and greed. They are not happy. Or if they are, they are unnatural.\n",

Can a company as intent upon domination as Amazon really understand this perspective — and adapt that morality to the screen?\n",

They repeatedly stress that American indigenous peoples had a worldview closer to the contemporary US than European Enlightenment thinkers, because American indigenous peoples were concerned with (substantive) freedom. It's a clever rhetorical move: both the original inhabitants of the American continents and the present inhabitants of the American continents are interested in freedom; the difference is, in what that freedom consists.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Holy Week of any year&mdash;that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb—always has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.</p>\n<p>I was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly—weekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.</p>\n<p>Laurel Marshall Potter—colleague, friend, housemate—and I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community—Jews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals—gathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opening-prayer\">opening prayer</h2>\n<p>The way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God’s love. It is not God’s will that this injustice persist; it is not God’s will that the powerful remain so; it is not God’s will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus’s long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice. This God walks the way of death in solidarity with all who suffer, as one who suffers, that they might suffer no more. The way ends on the cross in death—and by that very death, so ends death itself.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>\n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-first-station-jesus-is-condemned-to-death\">the first station. Jesus is condemned to death</h2>\n<p>Coronavirus has exposed what the poorest and most vulnerable among us have long known—ours is a culture of death. Eager for profits, for consumer goods, for power, our culture readily sacrifices its poor, its elderly, its vulnerable to the market. Jesus, like many today, is a victim of this culture: as religious authorities and the crowd looked on, he was condemned to death lest empire lose its grip on its colonial possession. Pilate thought he could exempt himself from this culture of death; he thought he could wash his hands of the violence. Little did he know his complicity in death is his responsibility for death.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>\n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-second-station-jesus-carries-his-cross\">the second station. Jesus carries his cross.</h2>\n<p>The poor and marginalized disproportionately carry the burden of the culture of death. Black and brown bodies, women, queer people, people who are immunocompromised, ill and disabled, prisoners, the elderly, and the abused all bear the weight of structures that uphold kingdoms of death.</p>\n<p>V.

Jesus’s third fall is perhaps the most crushing: it is in this moment that he realizes how alone he is. He has found small comforts along the way—the tears of his mother, the strength of Simon, the cloth of Veronica—but from here on out he is desperately alone. Our culture of death is a culture of isolation, for everyone dies alone. In that isolation is a spiritual desolation; apart from the fabric of our society, what meaning can our lives have?

				"content_text": "Holy Week of any year---that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb—always has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.\n\nI was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly—weekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.\n\nLaurel Marshall Potter—colleague, friend, housemate—and I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community—Jews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals—gathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.\n\n## opening prayer\nThe way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God’s love. It is not God’s will that this injustice persist; it is not God’s will that the powerful remain so; it is not God’s will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus’s long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice. This God walks the way of death in solidarity with all who suffer, as one who suffers, that they might suffer no more. The way ends on the cross in death—and by that very death, so ends death itself.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the first station. Jesus is condemned to death\nCoronavirus has exposed what the poorest and most vulnerable among us have long known—ours is a culture of death. Eager for profits, for consumer goods, for power, our culture readily sacrifices its poor, its elderly, its vulnerable to the market. Jesus, like many today, is a victim of this culture: as religious authorities and the crowd looked on, he was condemned to death lest empire lose its grip on its colonial possession. Pilate thought he could exempt himself from this culture of death; he thought he could wash his hands of the violence. Little did he know his complicity in death is his responsibility for death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the second station. Jesus carries his cross.\nThe poor and marginalized disproportionately carry the burden of the culture of death. Black and brown bodies, women, queer people, people who are immunocompromised, ill and disabled, prisoners, the elderly, and the abused all bear the weight of structures that uphold kingdoms of death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the third station. Jesus falls for the first time.\nUnder the weight of the cross, that symbol of death’s reign, Jesus stumbles. His stumble is that of the economic poor, then and now—those who subsist on inadequate wages, who do not have access to affordable healthcare or housing or proper nourishment. The weight is unbearable; he is brought to his knees, and not for the last time. His journey is only just beginning—how, under the weight of poverty and homelessness and material instability, can it be borne?\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the fourth station. Jesus meets his mother, Mary.\nHow acute Mary’s own pain when she sees the suffering of her child! When we love our family, chosen and given, we open ourselves up the pain of their suffering. Our relationships make us vulnerable, and they also make us human. Mary is not absent from Jesus’s crucifixion, even though it is painful, hopeless, maddening.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the fifth station. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross\n**Cuando el pobre crea en la pobre**  \n**Ya podremos cantar libertad**  \n**Cuando la/el pobre crea en el/la pobre,**  \n**Construiremos la fraternidad**  \n\nCuando el pobre busca al pobre  \ny nace la organización  \nes que empieza nuestra liberación.  \nCuando el pobre anuncia al pobre  \nla esperanza que Él nos dio,  \nYa su Reino entre nosotros nació.  \n\n**Coro**\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.\n\n## the sixth station. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus.\nKind gestures are not worthless. Though much more is needed to interrupt the crucifixions that surround us, we cannot deem small kindnesses unimportant. Veronica knows she cannot stop the parade of death, but she risks drawing near to Jesus to offer a fleeting moment of relief. Immediate, compassionate relief must be part of our response to the culture of death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.  \n℟.

Jesus is stripped of his clothes.\n>“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—  \nBecause I was not a socialist.  \nThen they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—  \nBecause I was not a trade unionist.  \nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—  \nBecause I was not a Jew.  \nThen they came for me—  \nand there was no one left to speak for me.”\n\nHaving robbed us of our solidarity, the culture of death, when it comes for us, strips us of all pretense of security, of control, and of belonging.

				"title": "Of baptism",
				"content_html": "<p>Dear C—,<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>This past Sunday, on a cool and bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism—something in which you had no say and of which you have no memory—creeping into your life in strange and unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all. I write this note in the hope it can offer some guidance here. Given the subject matter, this note is woefully short (despite its length!), but I hope it&rsquo;s helpful even still.</p>\n<p>The joys of life are many, and you&rsquo;ll come to learn these in time—riding a bike without training wheels, enjoying a meal you helped to prepare, reading a book your mom loved when she was your age. But when you have enjoyed all life has to offer and when you come to the end of your time on earth, there life&rsquo;s final obligation imposes itself. If you&rsquo;ll allow me to be blunt: all living things—human beings, animals, plants—must die. Even nonliving things tend toward decay—given enough time, rocks break down into sand, stars explode into stardust, houses fall apart. This is an unfortunate, tragic, unsettling fact, but a fact nonetheless.</p>\n<p>But it is exactly because of this burden of death that your parents had you baptized. Baptism, you see, is a remedy to the death into which all living things are born. When you were baptized, water was poured over your head three times. This ritual symbolically—though as Catholics we really ought to say &ldquo;sacramentally&rdquo;—puts the person being baptized to death; when she is lifted out of the baptismal font, she is raised to new life and made a member of the community founded by Christ and made up of all the baptized. This community—which we call &ldquo;the church&rdquo;—is freed by baptism from the reign of death and liberated into a reign of life. The freedom of the Christian is a freedom to live in and by the love of God—a love that is totally selfless and pure, concerned never for itself but always for the other.</p>\n<p>But just as being born naturally imposed upon you an obligation of death, so does being reborn sacramentally impose upon you an obligation. And as you would expect, the obligation baptism imposes is exactly the opposite of the one imposed by being born: the baptized are obliged to live!</p>\n<p>Christians have a peculiar understanding of what it is to live; peculiar, at least, according to how the rest of the world tends to think of what it is to live. For Christians to live, they must live for others—they must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger, visit the imprisoned. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapter 25 of Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel</a>; or the Sermon on the Mount, found in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapters 5–7 of the same Gospel</a>.) And very often, Christians must inconvenience themselves to live in this way—they must feed the hungry with their own food, clothe the naked with their own clothing, take the stranger into their own home, and visit the imprisoned on their own time.

There&rsquo;s a reason, after all, that there are people without enough food, or too poor for clothing or a home, or lacking the freedom you enjoy. For the Christian to live her life for others, then, and for her to spread life in a world of death, is a subversive, even dangerous, undertaking. Indeed, the Christian seeks nothing less than liberation for all those bound by chains of death: liberation from hunger and poverty, and, yes, from the literal chains of the prison yard. The Christian seeks to undo, once and for all, the pattern of death in the world. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A47-55&amp;version=RSVCE\">Mary&rsquo;s Magnificat toward the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke</a>.)</p>\n<p>This is the sort of subversive, dangerous trouble Jesus got himself into.

Ironically, it was this very act of violence against life that assured the final victory of life over death (but that&rsquo;s another email for another time; in the meantime, you might take a look at <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A35-58&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapter 15 of Paul&rsquo;s First Letter to the Corinthians, especially verses 35 and following</a>).</p>\n<p>The life that your baptism demands of you is subversive: for this reason, the world may try to stop you, as it did Jesus.

I hope this is not the case for you; but I also hope that you take the demands of your baptism seriously, and that you live the life you have been freed to live.

				"content_text": "Dear C—,[^1]\n\nThis past Sunday, on a cool and bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism—something in which you had no say and of which you have no memory—creeping into your life in strange and unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all. I write this note in the hope it can offer some guidance here. Given the subject matter, this note is woefully short (despite its length!), but I hope it's helpful even still.\n\nThe joys of life are many, and you'll come to learn these in time—riding a bike without training wheels, enjoying a meal you helped to prepare, reading a book your mom loved when she was your age. But when you have enjoyed all life has to offer and when you come to the end of your time on earth, there life's final obligation imposes itself. If you'll allow me to be blunt: all living things—human beings, animals, plants—must die. Even nonliving things tend toward decay—given enough time, rocks break down into sand, stars explode into stardust, houses fall apart. This is an unfortunate, tragic, unsettling fact, but a fact nonetheless.\n\nBut it is exactly because of this burden of death that your parents had you baptized. Baptism, you see, is a remedy to the death into which all living things are born. When you were baptized, water was poured over your head three times. This ritual symbolically—though as Catholics we really ought to say \"sacramentally\"—puts the person being baptized to death; when she is lifted out of the baptismal font, she is raised to new life and made a member of the community founded by Christ and made up of all the baptized. This community—which we call \"the church\"—is freed by baptism from the reign of death and liberated into a reign of life. The freedom of the Christian is a freedom to live in and by the love of God—a love that is totally selfless and pure, concerned never for itself but always for the other.\n\nBut just as being born naturally imposed upon you an obligation of death, so does being reborn sacramentally impose upon you an obligation. And as you would expect, the obligation baptism imposes is exactly the opposite of the one imposed by being born: the baptized are obliged to live!\n\nChristians have a peculiar understanding of what it is to live; peculiar, at least, according to how the rest of the world tends to think of what it is to live. For Christians to live, they must live for others—they must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger, visit the imprisoned. (For more on this, see [chapter 25 of Matthew's Gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&version=RSVCE); or the Sermon on the Mount, found in [chapters 5–7 of the same Gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&version=RSVCE).) And very often, Christians must inconvenience themselves to live in this way—they must feed the hungry with their own food, clothe the naked with their own clothing, take the stranger into their own home, and visit the imprisoned on their own time. (St. Basil the Great says the unworn jacket in your closet rightfully belongs to the poor person who has no jacket![^2]) In this way, the life you received in your baptism is not so much yours as it is others', especially those most in need of your help.\n\nThis obligation to live liberates us from the relentless rhythm of decay, that dirge of death according to which the rest of the world marches. Yet that baptismal obligation is not always pleasant—as I've just suggested, it involves a personal cost to the Christian. You may find yourself with less food than you might otherwise have because you've given some to your hungry neighbor, for example. What's more, you may find the task itself unpleasant. The hungry might lack table manners, or the poor decorum; the stranger's unusual customs might confuse you, and the prisoner's past might frighten. ([St. Vincent de Paul has some really lovely words on this](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul); I remain forever haunted by his claim: \"It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.\" I have tears in my eyes as I recall my own failings in this respect.)\n\nThere's another reason why we might shy away from baptism's obligation (and many, regrettably, do). The obligation of baptism to live runs directly contrary to the world and its designs. Unlike the white garment of life that the baptized wear, the world wears a death shroud and, wittingly or not, the world seeks to shroud more of the living in death.

He came into a world of death preaching a message of life and love; he rejected the status quo and sought to undo the patterns of death that keep all, oppressors and oppressed alike, in chains. But the powers that be would not stand for it; they dealt with the problem in the only way they knew how, and they had him killed.
