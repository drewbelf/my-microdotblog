It was meta without being too in-your-face about it (with maybe an exception or two here or there), &amp; there were some unexpected resonances with <em>Rope</em> (chiefly in the homoerotic subtext between Billy &amp; Stu).

I think it&rsquo;ll make the syllabus. The film obviously engages the book of Job but also has some pretty significant differences.

Another Wes Craven to finish out October. I thought this was pretty good, though I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much as <em>Scream</em>. It had some creepy sequences but I think I really only jumped once or twice (&amp; I tend to be very jumpy during scary movies). I liked Nancy&rsquo;s character.

Afterwards they will write a reflective essay in which they discuss their experience of service in connection with key themes &amp; ideas from the course. I was inspired to work this project into my course by my colleague, who had used service learning in the past, &amp; students responded well to the project last semester. This semester I&rsquo;ve worked to more fully integrate the project into my course, mainly by orienting all the other writing assignments in the course to the service learning project.</p>\n<p>Early in the semester, students will write a short essay articulating their understanding of &ldquo;Franciscan service,&rdquo; on the basis of a couple of readings we&rsquo;ll discuss in class (including selections of Pope Francis&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html\">Fratelli tutti</a></em>). This writing assignment will ask them to consider the difference between service &amp; solidarity, &amp; how they might embody solidarity in their own acts of service. This early writing assignment will help students begin to think about service in a Franciscan key, &amp; what they might want to do for their service project. (We&rsquo;ll also have time in class to brainstorm ideas &amp; begin planning projects.)</p>\n<p>Later on in the semester students will complete an in-class positionality mapping exercise (I learned a lot about this from <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1609406919870075\">Danielle Jacobson&rsquo;s &amp; Nida Mustafa&rsquo;s paper on social identity mapping</a>), which will form the basis of their second writing assignment. I don&rsquo;t ask students to share with me anything about their social position they&rsquo;re not comfortable sharing, but I do ask them to reflect in writing on how their social position informs their own particular worldview. That includes possible blind spots they may have as a consequence of their social position; that also includes a unique perspective or insight about the world they have thanks to their social position. My hope&mdash;&amp; I&rsquo;ll be explicit about this in class&mdash;is that students will think about the position <em>from which</em> they engage in service. What is it about their social location that puts them in a position to do service at all? How do their intersecting social positions inform they kind of good they want to do in their community?</p>\n<p>Then, in the latter half of the semester, students will write a couple short essays on Franciscan values. I&rsquo;ve already identified most of the possible values (e.g., non-possessiveness, fraternal living, universal kinship, peacemaking, etc.); students will choose one, find a quotation from Francis or Clare to illustrate it, &amp; then explain the value. These will come into play when students are reflecting on their experience in the service learning project.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the end of the semester students write a reflective essay drawing on their experience completing the service learning project. The reflective essay has a few parts to it. I&rsquo;ll ask them to think about to what extent their service learning project met the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; of Franciscan service they set in their first writing assignment. Students won&rsquo;t be graded on how &ldquo;Franciscan&rdquo; their project was; rather, I want students to think about how service does &amp; does not allow for the &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;&mdash;the change of social position&mdash;that Francis &amp; Clare lived in their own time.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll also ask students to think about how their social position may have shaped their experience of doing service. The goal here is that putting service in the context of one&rsquo;s social position will discourage the &ldquo;it felt so good to help someone&rdquo; attitude toward service, which I worry is patronizing &amp; shortcircuits questions about why we live in a world where such service is needed. Instead, I&rsquo;d like students to think more critically about themselves &amp; society&mdash;what about their privilege positions them to do service like this? How might students choose to live in ways that counteract the societal arrangements that marginalize or oppress people?</p>\n<p>Students will further reflect on Franciscan values in connection with their experience of service. They might use what we learned in the classroom to analyze &amp; interpret their experience, or they might use their experience to shed new light on the ideas learned &amp; discussed in class.</p>\n<p>The reflective essay, then, draws upon each of the previous writing assignments while asking students to rethink some of their earlier thoughts in light of the service experience. I hope this project gives a clear throughline to the course as a whole; I hope, too, that it conveys to students the nature of learning as cumulative &amp; always needing revision. (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a more elegant way to say that.) Basically: knowledge&mdash;in all its forms&mdash;builds &amp; often requires us to adjust what we previously thought about the world.</p>\n<p>While I&rsquo;ve done this service learning project before, this is the first time I&rsquo;m teaching it as a fully integrated component of the course.

That world includes some theological ideas that medieval Christians took for granted & that find peculiar expression in Francis & Clare‚Äôs lives & writings: ideas like creation, sin, the kingdom of God, [the incompatibility of living for God & living for money](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19%3A16-26&version=NRSVCE), the redeeming suffering & death of Jesus, martyrdom & monasticism.

In setting this context, too, students can begin to draw connections between Francis & Clare‚Äôs world & our own. Wealth & income inequality are not, after all, unfamiliar phenomena to us today; neither is social isolation brought about by new technologies & societal circumstances.\n\n## Second, we pay attention to Francis & Clare‚Äôs own words & deeds,\n\nespecially how these words & deeds respond to their particular historical & cultural moment. We begin by looking at ‚Äòpenance‚Äô, for this is the decisive impulse of Francis‚Äôs life.

Cusato, ofm, ‚ÄúTo Do Penance / *Facere Poenitentiam*,‚Äù *The Cord* 57, no. 1 (2007): 3‚Äì24.\n\nPoverty is another major theme in this part of the course; here again contextualizing Francis & Clare helps illuminate this supremely countercultural practice.[^3a] Francis & Clare refuse to handle money not just out of gospel fidelity or trust in God, but as a gesture responding directly to the violence wrought by an emerging money economy.[^4] Their embrace of poverty is something of a protest: against the ascendancy of the transactional over the personal in human relationship, & against the evaluation of persons (or, more distressingly for Francis & Clare, the de-valuation of persons) based on economic status.[^5]\n\n[^3a]: William Short, ofm, in his *Poverty & Joy: The Franciscan Tradition* (Orbis Books, 1999) helps explain Francis's practice of poverty & Clare's role as the \"first interpreter\" of Francis.

How should human beings who enjoy some degree of privilege respond with mercy & compassion to [the cry of the earth & the cry of the poor](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html)? We ask these & related questions in light of our study of Francis & Clare.\n\nThe goal of ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis & Clare‚Äù is not just to know a little bit about the personalities behind the mission & values of SBU; the goal is also to consider how Francis & Clare continue to speak to people of good will today, urging us to patterns of life that prefer mercy to cruelty, compassion to apathy, generosity to wealth, justice to oppression. Whether they are heard today depends as much on the students as it does the instructor, but if we cannot hear Francis & Clare in their own day we certainly cannot hear them in ours.\n",

[His homily for this first Sunday in Lent](http://homileticdiakonia.blogspot.com/2022/03/lent-1.html) is particularly good. As it happens I was teaching evil as *privatio boni* to my Catholic theology class on the day Putin's invasion of Ukraine and was put in the awkward position of saying evil doesn't really exist on a day when unspeakable evils were underway. Like Bauerschmidt, I used Herbert McCabe's image of evil as hole-in-sock to try to balance both *privatio boni* and our real experience of evil as surd.

				"content_html": "<p>Holy Week of any year&mdash;that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb‚Äîalways has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.</p>\n<p>I was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly‚Äîweekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.</p>\n<p>Laurel Marshall Potter‚Äîcolleague, friend, housemate‚Äîand I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community‚ÄîJews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals‚Äîgathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opening-prayer\">opening prayer</h2>\n<p>The way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God‚Äôs love. It is not God‚Äôs will that this injustice persist; it is not God‚Äôs will that the powerful remain so; it is not God‚Äôs will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus‚Äôs long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice. This God walks the way of death in solidarity with all who suffer, as one who suffers, that they might suffer no more. The way ends on the cross in death‚Äîand by that very death, so ends death itself.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-first-station-jesus-is-condemned-to-death\">the first station. Jesus is condemned to death</h2>\n<p>Coronavirus has exposed what the poorest and most vulnerable among us have long known‚Äîours is a culture of death. Eager for profits, for consumer goods, for power, our culture readily sacrifices its poor, its elderly, its vulnerable to the market. Jesus, like many today, is a victim of this culture: as religious authorities and the crowd looked on, he was condemned to death lest empire lose its grip on its colonial possession. Pilate thought he could exempt himself from this culture of death; he thought he could wash his hands of the violence. Little did he know his complicity in death is his responsibility for death.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-second-station-jesus-carries-his-cross\">the second station. Jesus carries his cross.</h2>\n<p>The poor and marginalized disproportionately carry the burden of the culture of death. Black and brown bodies, women, queer people, people who are immunocompromised, ill and disabled, prisoners, the elderly, and the abused all bear the weight of structures that uphold kingdoms of death.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-third-station-jesus-falls-for-the-first-time\">the third station. Jesus falls for the first time.</h2>\n<p>Under the weight of the cross, that symbol of death‚Äôs reign, Jesus stumbles. His stumble is that of the economic poor, then and now‚Äîthose who subsist on inadequate wages, who do not have access to affordable healthcare or housing or proper nourishment. The weight is unbearable; he is brought to his knees, and not for the last time. His journey is only just beginning‚Äîhow, under the weight of poverty and homelessness and material instability, can it be borne?</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fourth-station-jesus-meets-his-mother-mary\">the fourth station. Jesus meets his mother, Mary.</h2>\n<p>How acute Mary‚Äôs own pain when she sees the suffering of her child! When we love our family, chosen and given, we open ourselves up the pain of their suffering. Our relationships make us vulnerable, and they also make us human. Mary is not absent from Jesus‚Äôs crucifixion, even though it is painful, hopeless, maddening.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fifth-station-simon-of-cyrene-helps-jesus-carry-his-cross\">the fifth station. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross</h2>\n<p><strong>Cuando el pobre crea en la pobre</strong><br>\n<strong>Ya podremos cantar libertad</strong><br>\n<strong>Cuando la/el pobre crea en el/la pobre,</strong><br>\n<strong>Construiremos la fraternidad</strong></p>\n<p>Cuando el pobre busca al pobre<br>\ny nace la organizaci√≥n<br>\nes que empieza nuestra liberaci√≥n.<br>\nCuando el pobre anuncia al pobre<br>\nla esperanza que √âl nos dio,<br>\nYa su Reino entre nosotros naci√≥.</p>\n<p><strong>Coro</strong></p>\n<p>V.

Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-sixth-station-veronica-wipes-the-face-of-jesus\">the sixth station. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus.</h2>\n<p>Kind gestures are not worthless. Though much more is needed to interrupt the crucifixions that surround us, we cannot deem small kindnesses unimportant. Veronica knows she cannot stop the parade of death, but she risks drawing near to Jesus to offer a fleeting moment of relief. Immediate, compassionate relief must be part of our response to the culture of death.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-seventh-station-jesus-falls-for-the-second-time\">the seventh station. Jesus falls for the second time.</h2>\n<p>Again, death‚Äôs weight is too much‚ÄîJesus falls. He fears for himself, certainly, but he fears for his family, his disciples, his people. Jesus is not free of the anxiety of death; neither are we. Especially in times of uncertainty as our physical health is at risk, so too is our mental health. Worry, anxiety, fear, depression‚Äîthese and other demons torment us. When we are responsible for the well-being of others, our mental health is only further strained. We feel we can hardly bear it.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-eighth-station-jesus-meets-the-women-of-jerusalem\">the eighth station. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem.</h2>\n<p>Jerusalem was weak compared to Rome, but strong compared to Nazareth. These privileged women, residents of a politically strategic city, express culturally sanctioned horror and pity for the poor radical from backwater Galilee. They play their role in the drama of Roman crucifixions. Jesus says to them, ‚ÄúDaughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.‚Äù Their sense of security is an illusion, and their false pity is damning. We are all both complicit and dehumanized by the culture of death.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ninth-station-jesus-falls-for-the-third-time\">the ninth station. Jesus falls for the third time.</h2>\n<p>Even in moments of physical and mental strength, we are not immune to social isolation and spiritual desolation. Jesus‚Äôs third fall is perhaps the most crushing: it is in this moment that he realizes how alone he is. He has found small comforts along the way‚Äîthe tears of his mother, the strength of Simon, the cloth of Veronica‚Äîbut from here on out he is desperately alone. Our culture of death is a culture of isolation, for everyone dies alone. In that isolation is a spiritual desolation; apart from the fabric of our society, what meaning can our lives have? The isolation of coronavirus is a symptom of a deeper sickness: a culture that does not allow us community and solidarity.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-tenth-station-jesus-is-stripped-of-his-clothes\">the tenth station. Jesus is stripped of his clothes.</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äî<br>\nBecause I was not a socialist.<br>\nThen they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out‚Äî<br>\nBecause I was not a trade unionist.<br>\nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äî<br>\nBecause I was not a Jew.<br>\nThen they came for me‚Äî<br>\nand there was no one left to speak for me.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having robbed us of our solidarity, the culture of death, when it comes for us, strips us of all pretense of security, of control, and of belonging. We fear the day that our illusion of invincibility is stripped from us.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-eleventh-station-jesus-is-nailed-to-the-cross\">the eleventh station. Jesus is nailed to the cross.</h2>\n<p>The nails by which Jesus is fixed to the cross is the physical pain and torture by which empire keeps its power. Jesus was a discontent, a threat, a rabble rouser‚Äîhe was a problem that required a ‚Äújust‚Äù solution. Crucifixion‚Äîstate-sanctioned violence‚Äîis that ‚Äújustice,‚Äù a demonic perversion of God‚Äôs true justice. Jesus cries out as the nails pierce his flesh, but the soldiers care not; he gasps for breath as the cross is lifted up, but the crowd jeers still. Empire has power; empire keeps power. It is the way of the world.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-twelfth-station-jesus-dies-on-the-cross\">the twelfth station. Jesus dies on the cross.</h2>\n<p>‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?‚Äù The Gospel writers cite the psalmist in the moment of Jesus‚Äôs death on the cross, and claim that Jesus really does die‚Äîhe goes to the place of the dead. He dies torn between belief in a God who has promised life and the reality of his own death.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-thirteenth-station-jesus-is-taken-down-from-the-cross\">the thirteenth station. Jesus is taken down from the cross.</h2>\n<p>After all this, the long walk from Pilate‚Äôs court to Golgotha, the end is almost anticlimactic. Jesus dies, not without a shout, but he dies nonetheless. What remains verges on mundane‚Äîhe must be removed from the cross, arrangements must be made, a funeral must be planned. There will be time enough to grieve later; for now, there are things to be done. There is a numbness; someone who was once a fixture of our lives is now gone.</p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fourteenth-station-jesus-is-placed-in-the-tomb\">the fourteenth station. Jesus is placed in the tomb.</h2>\n<p>I remember one time at a funeral in Santa Tecla: a family stood around their grandmother‚Äôs grave as the gravediggers began to shovel dirt on top of her lowered coffin. As the dirt fell and hit the bottom, the thud was the only sound we could hear. The finality of the dirt on the coffin was the only real thing in the world. It was a final goodbye. The disciples must have felt this same kind of grief at the finality of Jesus‚Äôs death and the end of what they thought was the call of their lives.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.<br>\n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-prayer\">closing prayer</h2>\n<p>The disciples were sure it was over. Even if Jesus‚Äôs voice echoed in their heads, it was just that‚Äîan echo. There was little else they could do but return to their fishing nets and try to carry on with some semblance of a normal life. Even though Jesus defied their expectations in life, still they could not imagine a reality beyond death. That‚Äôs what death meant. It was over.</p>\n<p>As the disciples could not imagine a future for Jesus beyond his death, neither can we imagine a future beyond the cultures of death that constrain our lives.</p>\n<p>Walking this way of the cross with Jesus, we see the pervasiveness of this death culture. We have seen the seemingly insurmountable power of injustice, and we have witnessed our own complicity in that injustice. It seems foolish to hope that it could be otherwise, that we could be freed of the structures of sin that constrain our freedom and flourishing, that the systems of injustice could be dismantled. Who will beat the guns into plowshares when there are wars to be fought?</p>\n<p>Yet this is our hope. This is what God has promised, again and again in the Law and in the Prophets and in the Gospels. We know not when or how, but we do know this‚ÄîGod always finds the unlooked-for solution. God always creates new realities and paradigms beyond our imaginative capacities to be in relationship with us. This is our hope, foolish though it may seem, that God will do good on God‚Äôs promise.

				"content_text": "Holy Week of any year---that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb‚Äîalways has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.\n\nI was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly‚Äîweekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.\n\nLaurel Marshall Potter‚Äîcolleague, friend, housemate‚Äîand I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community‚ÄîJews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals‚Äîgathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.\n\n## opening prayer\nThe way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God‚Äôs love. It is not God‚Äôs will that this injustice persist; it is not God‚Äôs will that the powerful remain so; it is not God‚Äôs will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus‚Äôs long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice. This God walks the way of death in solidarity with all who suffer, as one who suffers, that they might suffer no more. The way ends on the cross in death‚Äîand by that very death, so ends death itself.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the first station. Jesus is condemned to death\nCoronavirus has exposed what the poorest and most vulnerable among us have long known‚Äîours is a culture of death. Eager for profits, for consumer goods, for power, our culture readily sacrifices its poor, its elderly, its vulnerable to the market. Jesus, like many today, is a victim of this culture: as religious authorities and the crowd looked on, he was condemned to death lest empire lose its grip on its colonial possession. Pilate thought he could exempt himself from this culture of death; he thought he could wash his hands of the violence. Little did he know his complicity in death is his responsibility for death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the second station. Jesus carries his cross.\nThe poor and marginalized disproportionately carry the burden of the culture of death. Black and brown bodies, women, queer people, people who are immunocompromised, ill and disabled, prisoners, the elderly, and the abused all bear the weight of structures that uphold kingdoms of death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the third station. Jesus falls for the first time.\nUnder the weight of the cross, that symbol of death‚Äôs reign, Jesus stumbles. His stumble is that of the economic poor, then and now‚Äîthose who subsist on inadequate wages, who do not have access to affordable healthcare or housing or proper nourishment. The weight is unbearable; he is brought to his knees, and not for the last time. His journey is only just beginning‚Äîhow, under the weight of poverty and homelessness and material instability, can it be borne?\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the fourth station. Jesus meets his mother, Mary.\nHow acute Mary‚Äôs own pain when she sees the suffering of her child! When we love our family, chosen and given, we open ourselves up the pain of their suffering. Our relationships make us vulnerable, and they also make us human. Mary is not absent from Jesus‚Äôs crucifixion, even though it is painful, hopeless, maddening.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the fifth station. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross\n**Cuando el pobre crea en la pobre**  \n**Ya podremos cantar libertad**  \n**Cuando la/el pobre crea en el/la pobre,**  \n**Construiremos la fraternidad**  \n\nCuando el pobre busca al pobre  \ny nace la organizaci√≥n  \nes que empieza nuestra liberaci√≥n.  \nCuando el pobre anuncia al pobre  \nla esperanza que √âl nos dio,  \nYa su Reino entre nosotros naci√≥.  \n\n**Coro**\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the sixth station. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus.\nKind gestures are not worthless. Though much more is needed to interrupt the crucifixions that surround us, we cannot deem small kindnesses unimportant. Veronica knows she cannot stop the parade of death, but she risks drawing near to Jesus to offer a fleeting moment of relief. Immediate, compassionate relief must be part of our response to the culture of death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the seventh station. Jesus falls for the second time.\nAgain, death‚Äôs weight is too much‚ÄîJesus falls. He fears for himself, certainly, but he fears for his family, his disciples, his people. Jesus is not free of the anxiety of death; neither are we. Especially in times of uncertainty as our physical health is at risk, so too is our mental health. Worry, anxiety, fear, depression‚Äîthese and other demons torment us. When we are responsible for the well-being of others, our mental health is only further strained. We feel we can hardly bear it.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the eighth station. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem.\nJerusalem was weak compared to Rome, but strong compared to Nazareth. These privileged women, residents of a politically strategic city, express culturally sanctioned horror and pity for the poor radical from backwater Galilee. They play their role in the drama of Roman crucifixions. Jesus says to them, ‚ÄúDaughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.‚Äù Their sense of security is an illusion, and their false pity is damning. We are all both complicit and dehumanized by the culture of death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the ninth station. Jesus falls for the third time.\nEven in moments of physical and mental strength, we are not immune to social isolation and spiritual desolation. Jesus‚Äôs third fall is perhaps the most crushing: it is in this moment that he realizes how alone he is. He has found small comforts along the way‚Äîthe tears of his mother, the strength of Simon, the cloth of Veronica‚Äîbut from here on out he is desperately alone. Our culture of death is a culture of isolation, for everyone dies alone. In that isolation is a spiritual desolation; apart from the fabric of our society, what meaning can our lives have? The isolation of coronavirus is a symptom of a deeper sickness: a culture that does not allow us community and solidarity.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the tenth station. Jesus is stripped of his clothes.\n>‚ÄúFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äî  \nBecause I was not a socialist.  \nThen they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out‚Äî  \nBecause I was not a trade unionist.  \nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äî  \nBecause I was not a Jew.  \nThen they came for me‚Äî  \nand there was no one left to speak for me.‚Äù\n\nHaving robbed us of our solidarity, the culture of death, when it comes for us, strips us of all pretense of security, of control, and of belonging. We fear the day that our illusion of invincibility is stripped from us.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the eleventh station. Jesus is nailed to the cross.\nThe nails by which Jesus is fixed to the cross is the physical pain and torture by which empire keeps its power. Jesus was a discontent, a threat, a rabble rouser‚Äîhe was a problem that required a ‚Äújust‚Äù solution. Crucifixion‚Äîstate-sanctioned violence‚Äîis that ‚Äújustice,‚Äù a demonic perversion of God‚Äôs true justice. Jesus cries out as the nails pierce his flesh, but the soldiers care not; he gasps for breath as the cross is lifted up, but the crowd jeers still. Empire has power; empire keeps power. It is the way of the world.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the twelfth station. Jesus dies on the cross.\n‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?‚Äù The Gospel writers cite the psalmist in the moment of Jesus‚Äôs death on the cross, and claim that Jesus really does die‚Äîhe goes to the place of the dead. He dies torn between belief in a God who has promised life and the reality of his own death.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the thirteenth station. Jesus is taken down from the cross.\nAfter all this, the long walk from Pilate‚Äôs court to Golgotha, the end is almost anticlimactic. Jesus dies, not without a shout, but he dies nonetheless. What remains verges on mundane‚Äîhe must be removed from the cross, arrangements must be made, a funeral must be planned. There will be time enough to grieve later; for now, there are things to be done. There is a numbness; someone who was once a fixture of our lives is now gone.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## the fourteenth station. Jesus is placed in the tomb.\nI remember one time at a funeral in Santa Tecla: a family stood around their grandmother‚Äôs grave as the gravediggers began to shovel dirt on top of her lowered coffin. As the dirt fell and hit the bottom, the thud was the only sound we could hear. The finality of the dirt on the coffin was the only real thing in the world. It was a final goodbye. The disciples must have felt this same kind of grief at the finality of Jesus‚Äôs death and the end of what they thought was the call of their lives.[^1]\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü. Dios, t√∫ no despreciar√°s un coraz√≥n penitente y roto.\n\n## closing prayer\nThe disciples were sure it was over. Even if Jesus‚Äôs voice echoed in their heads, it was just that‚Äîan echo. There was little else they could do but return to their fishing nets and try to carry on with some semblance of a normal life. Even though Jesus defied their expectations in life, still they could not imagine a reality beyond death. That‚Äôs what death meant. It was over.\n\nAs the disciples could not imagine a future for Jesus beyond his death, neither can we imagine a future beyond the cultures of death that constrain our lives.\n\nWalking this way of the cross with Jesus, we see the pervasiveness of this death culture. We have seen the seemingly insurmountable power of injustice, and we have witnessed our own complicity in that injustice. It seems foolish to hope that it could be otherwise, that we could be freed of the structures of sin that constrain our freedom and flourishing, that the systems of injustice could be dismantled. Who will beat the guns into plowshares when there are wars to be fought?\n\nYet this is our hope. This is what God has promised, again and again in the Law and in the Prophets and in the Gospels. We know not when or how, but we do know this‚ÄîGod always finds the unlooked-for solution. God always creates new realities and paradigms beyond our imaginative capacities to be in relationship with us. This is our hope, foolish though it may seem, that God will do good on God‚Äôs promise. On this darkest of days, out of the very depths of despair, we can but cry our foolish hope: ‚ÄúHosanna, hosanna in the highest.‚Äù\n\n‚Ñü. Glory be to God, now and forever. Amen. \n\n[^1]: This story is Laurel's.\n",

				"title": "Of baptism",
				"content_html": "<p>Dear C‚Äî,<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>This past Sunday, on a cool and bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism‚Äîsomething in which you had no say and of which you have no memory‚Äîcreeping into your life in strange and unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all. I write this note in the hope it can offer some guidance here. Given the subject matter, this note is woefully short (despite its length!), but I hope it&rsquo;s helpful even still.</p>\n<p>The joys of life are many, and you&rsquo;ll come to learn these in time‚Äîriding a bike without training wheels, enjoying a meal you helped to prepare, reading a book your mom loved when she was your age. But when you have enjoyed all life has to offer and when you come to the end of your time on earth, there life&rsquo;s final obligation imposes itself. If you&rsquo;ll allow me to be blunt: all living things‚Äîhuman beings, animals, plants‚Äîmust die. Even nonliving things tend toward decay‚Äîgiven enough time, rocks break down into sand, stars explode into stardust, houses fall apart. This is an unfortunate, tragic, unsettling fact, but a fact nonetheless.</p>\n<p>But it is exactly because of this burden of death that your parents had you baptized. Baptism, you see, is a remedy to the death into which all living things are born. When you were baptized, water was poured over your head three times. This ritual symbolically‚Äîthough as Catholics we really ought to say &ldquo;sacramentally&rdquo;‚Äîputs the person being baptized to death; when she is lifted out of the baptismal font, she is raised to new life and made a member of the community founded by Christ and made up of all the baptized. This community‚Äîwhich we call &ldquo;the church&rdquo;‚Äîis freed by baptism from the reign of death and liberated into a reign of life. The freedom of the Christian is a freedom to live in and by the love of God‚Äîa love that is totally selfless and pure, concerned never for itself but always for the other.</p>\n<p>But just as being born naturally imposed upon you an obligation of death, so does being reborn sacramentally impose upon you an obligation. And as you would expect, the obligation baptism imposes is exactly the opposite of the one imposed by being born: the baptized are obliged to live!</p>\n<p>Christians have a peculiar understanding of what it is to live; peculiar, at least, according to how the rest of the world tends to think of what it is to live. For Christians to live, they must live for others‚Äîthey must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger, visit the imprisoned. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapter 25 of Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel</a>; or the Sermon on the Mount, found in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapters 5‚Äì7 of the same Gospel</a>.) And very often, Christians must inconvenience themselves to live in this way‚Äîthey must feed the hungry with their own food, clothe the naked with their own clothing, take the stranger into their own home, and visit the imprisoned on their own time. (St. Basil the Great says the unworn jacket in your closet rightfully belongs to the poor person who has no jacket!<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>) In this way, the life you received in your baptism is not so much yours as it is others', especially those most in need of your help.</p>\n<p>This obligation to live liberates us from the relentless rhythm of decay, that dirge of death according to which the rest of the world marches. Yet that baptismal obligation is not always pleasant‚Äîas I&rsquo;ve just suggested, it involves a personal cost to the Christian. You may find yourself with less food than you might otherwise have because you&rsquo;ve given some to your hungry neighbor, for example. What&rsquo;s more, you may find the task itself unpleasant. The hungry might lack table manners, or the poor decorum; the stranger&rsquo;s unusual customs might confuse you, and the prisoner&rsquo;s past might frighten. (<a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul\">St. Vincent de Paul has some really lovely words on this</a>; I remain forever haunted by his claim: &ldquo;It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.&rdquo; I have tears in my eyes as I recall my own failings in this respect.)</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another reason why we might shy away from baptism&rsquo;s obligation (and many, regrettably, do). The obligation of baptism to live runs directly contrary to the world and its designs. Unlike the white garment of life that the baptized wear, the world wears a death shroud and, wittingly or not, the world seeks to shroud more of the living in death. There&rsquo;s a reason, after all, that there are people without enough food, or too poor for clothing or a home, or lacking the freedom you enjoy. For the Christian to live her life for others, then, and for her to spread life in a world of death, is a subversive, even dangerous, undertaking. Indeed, the Christian seeks nothing less than liberation for all those bound by chains of death: liberation from hunger and poverty, and, yes, from the literal chains of the prison yard. The Christian seeks to undo, once and for all, the pattern of death in the world. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A47-55&amp;version=RSVCE\">Mary&rsquo;s Magnificat toward the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke</a>.)</p>\n<p>This is the sort of subversive, dangerous trouble Jesus got himself into. He came into a world of death preaching a message of life and love; he rejected the status quo and sought to undo the patterns of death that keep all, oppressors and oppressed alike, in chains. But the powers that be would not stand for it; they dealt with the problem in the only way they knew how, and they had him killed. Ironically, it was this very act of violence against life that assured the final victory of life over death (but that&rsquo;s another email for another time; in the meantime, you might take a look at <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A35-58&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapter 15 of Paul&rsquo;s First Letter to the Corinthians, especially verses 35 and following</a>).</p>\n<p>The life that your baptism demands of you is subversive: for this reason, the world may try to stop you, as it did Jesus. There will be some who take advantage of your generosity; there will be some who ridicule you for what they take to be foolishness on your part; there may even be some who commit acts of violence against you, so desperate will they be to stop the liberation you bring. I hope this is not the case for you; but I also hope that you take the demands of your baptism seriously, and that you live the life you have been freed to live. St. Irenaeus, one of the first theologians in the church&rsquo;s history, said that the glory of God is the human being fully alive. I hope you glorify God in all that you do by rejecting death and choosing to be fully alive for the liberation of yourself and of all.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you find yourself inspired by the liberating power of your baptism; perhaps you find yourself daunted at the prospect of such a demanding life; perhaps you find yourself vaguely annoyed at having spent so much time reading all this nonsense! (I hope it&rsquo;s not that last one, but I&rsquo;m aware it&rsquo;s at least a possibility.) However you respond to this‚Äîwhether positively, negatively, or even indifferently‚ÄîI hope you know there are people in your life who will always be available to talk to you about this. Your mom and dad rightly saw the good of baptism and so decided it was for you; your aunt V‚Äî and uncle B‚Äî as your godparents, have a special responsibility to guide you in matters of faith and spirituality; and I hope you&rsquo;ll think of me as someone you can talk to about this. I promise you&rsquo;ll always find in these people generous listeners, patient conversation partners, and loving family members. I look forward to the day we can talk about some of this, but until then I remain‚Äî</p>\n<p>your uncle by law and your brother in Christ,<br>\nDrew</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I wrote this note for my niece on the occassion of her baptism.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>In his homily <em>I Will Tear Down My Barns</em>: ‚ÄúWhen someone steals another&rsquo;s clothes, we call them a thief.

([St. Vincent de Paul has some really lovely words on this](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul); I remain forever haunted by his claim: \"It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.\" I have tears in my eyes as I recall my own failings in this respect.)\n\nThere's another reason why we might shy away from baptism's obligation (and many, regrettably, do). The obligation of baptism to live runs directly contrary to the world and its designs. Unlike the white garment of life that the baptized wear, the world wears a death shroud and, wittingly or not, the world seeks to shroud more of the living in death. There's a reason, after all, that there are people without enough food, or too poor for clothing or a home, or lacking the freedom you enjoy. For the Christian to live her life for others, then, and for her to spread life in a world of death, is a subversive, even dangerous, undertaking. Indeed, the Christian seeks nothing less than liberation for all those bound by chains of death: liberation from hunger and poverty, and, yes, from the literal chains of the prison yard. The Christian seeks to undo, once and for all, the pattern of death in the world. (For more on this, see [Mary's Magnificat toward the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A47-55&version=RSVCE).)\n\nThis is the sort of subversive, dangerous trouble Jesus got himself into. He came into a world of death preaching a message of life and love; he rejected the status quo and sought to undo the patterns of death that keep all, oppressors and oppressed alike, in chains. But the powers that be would not stand for it; they dealt with the problem in the only way they knew how, and they had him killed. Ironically, it was this very act of violence against life that assured the final victory of life over death (but that's another email for another time; in the meantime, you might take a look at [chapter 15 of Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians, especially verses 35 and following](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A35-58&version=RSVCE)).\n\nThe life that your baptism demands of you is subversive: for this reason, the world may try to stop you, as it did Jesus. There will be some who take advantage of your generosity; there will be some who ridicule you for what they take to be foolishness on your part; there may even be some who commit acts of violence against you, so desperate will they be to stop the liberation you bring. I hope this is not the case for you; but I also hope that you take the demands of your baptism seriously, and that you live the life you have been freed to live. St. Irenaeus, one of the first theologians in the church's history, said that the glory of God is the human being fully alive. I hope you glorify God in all that you do by rejecting death and choosing to be fully alive for the liberation of yourself and of all.\n\nPerhaps you find yourself inspired by the liberating power of your baptism; perhaps you find yourself daunted at the prospect of such a demanding life; perhaps you find yourself vaguely annoyed at having spent so much time reading all this nonsense! (I hope it's not that last one, but I'm aware it's at least a possibility.) However you respond to this‚Äîwhether positively, negatively, or even indifferently‚ÄîI hope you know there are people in your life who will always be available to talk to you about this. Your mom and dad rightly saw the good of baptism and so decided it was for you; your aunt V‚Äî and uncle B‚Äî as your godparents, have a special responsibility to guide you in matters of faith and spirituality; and I hope you'll think of me as someone you can talk to about this. I promise you'll always find in these people generous listeners, patient conversation partners, and loving family members. I look forward to the day we can talk about some of this, but until then I remain‚Äî\n\nyour uncle by law and your brother in Christ,  \nDrew\n\n[^1]: I wrote this note for my niece on the occassion of her baptism.\n[^2]: In his homily *I Will Tear Down My Barns*: ‚ÄúWhen someone steals another's clothes, we call them a thief. Should we not give the same name to one who could clothe the naked and does not? The bread in your cupboard belongs to the hungry; the coat unused in your closet belongs to the one who needs it; the shoes rotting in your closet belong to the one who has no shoes; the money which you hoard up belongs to the poor.‚Äù  \n",
