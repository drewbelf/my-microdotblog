That is when the question of forgiveness actually opens. It does not open up when you have a situation where somebody is not responsible for the offense. That’s not forgiveness. Forgiveness is when you decide to permanently forgo seeking restitution or vengeance&mdash;or however you want to think about it&mdash;for an offense that someone really did commit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So whatever forgiveness is, &amp; I do think it is a personal virtue as well as a social virtue, it’s certainly not something you do for your own pleasure or your own health. The person doing the forgiving isn’t getting a lot of bang for their buck. The person who benefits way out of proportion to what they’ve done is the offender.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Forgiveness is not deserved by definition. It’s not something somebody earns. It’s something that’s freely given.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I say that I have four people that I’ve forgiven for things they’ve done to me. &amp; it’s a decision that’s kind of like the 12 Steps program: You remake it every day, &amp; you do it every day. Because sometimes it’ll come to you, the thing that happened. You’re standing at the sink or looking out the window at the bird feeder, &amp; the fury comes back to you &amp; you want to explode all over again. At that point, you have to remake the decision to forgive. A lot of forgiveness, at least as it’s manifested in my life, is me reaching out &amp; being there, &amp; being friendly &amp; warm &amp; open for the restoration of a relationship with a person who hurt me &amp; saying, “I’m still here, I’m not going anywhere.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
				"content_text": "Excerpts from Sean Illing & Elizabeth Bruenig on [why is it so hard to forgive](https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast/2021/7/12/22379647/vox-conversations-elizabeth-bruenig-forgiveness-social-media).\n\n> But the truth is that forgiveness pertains to a situation in which the person is guilty & culpable. That is when the question of forgiveness actually opens. It does not open up when you have a situation where somebody is not responsible for the offense. That’s not forgiveness. Forgiveness is when you decide to permanently forgo seeking restitution or vengeance---or however you want to think about it---for an offense that someone really did commit.\n\n> So whatever forgiveness is, & I do think it is a personal virtue as well as a social virtue, it’s certainly not something you do for your own pleasure or your own health. The person doing the forgiving isn’t getting a lot of bang for their buck. The person who benefits way out of proportion to what they’ve done is the offender.\n\n> Forgiveness is not deserved by definition. It’s not something somebody earns. It’s something that’s freely given.\n\n> I say that I have four people that I’ve forgiven for things they’ve done to me. & it’s a decision that’s kind of like the 12 Steps program: You remake it every day, & you do it every day. Because sometimes it’ll come to you, the thing that happened. You’re standing at the sink or looking out the window at the bird feeder, & the fury comes back to you & you want to explode all over again. At that point, you have to remake the decision to forgive. A lot of forgiveness, at least as it’s manifested in my life, is me reaching out & being there, & being friendly & warm & open for the restoration of a relationship with a person who hurt me & saying, “I’m still here, I’m not going anywhere.”\n",

New forms of life have come from unexpected places&mdash;from Athanasius at local councils, Benedict in the monasteries, Albertus and Thomas in the universities, Francis of Assisi in the lanes and roads, Ignatius alone with a penitent making <em>The Spiritual Exercises</em>, Xavier and Ricci out at the rim of the world, Acton and Newman in pamphlets and journals.</p>\n<p>These stirrings of life are not normally inspired, or even approved, by officials. Their leaders were held suspect, their teachings suppressed. Reformers could count themselves lucky if they were only silenced (like Abelard and Newman), condemned (like Erasmus and Wyclif), exiled by church authorities (like Athanasius and Chrysostom), or jailed by them (like St. John of the Cross and St. Ignatius of Loyola)&mdash;after all, St. Joan and Savonarola and John Hus were tortured and killed by them.

It’s sad to say, but God feels he has failed with certain societies, and I think that the passages from Isaiah and Saint Paul that we read today have become a very sad Salvadoran reality: “I looked for righteousness, and behold, murders! I looked for justice, and behold, laments!” ([Isa. 5:7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Is5.7)).\n",

We get attached to people and ideals, thoughts and projects that are themselves vulnerable. And we respond to that vulnerability by becoming active ourselves in making sense of what it all meant or will continue to mean. Other animals suffer loss; other animals grieve in complex ways. If we want, we can call that mourning. But our form of mourning is an attempt to turn loss into a reanimated gain&mdash;in imagination, thought, emotion and, importantly, symbolic expression.

				"content_text": "[Jonathan Lear](https://thepointmag.com/remarks/when-meghan-married-harry/):\n\n>Freud said that mourning is a \"great riddle,\" and its greatness partially consists in its not being the kind of riddle that gets solved. Mourning, he says, is \"one of those phenomena which cannot themselves be explained but to which other obscurities can be traced back.\" In essence, mourning is one of the ways we exercise our capacity for love. We get attached to people and ideals, thoughts and projects that are themselves vulnerable. And we respond to that vulnerability by becoming active ourselves in making sense of what it all meant or will continue to mean. Other animals suffer loss; other animals grieve in complex ways. If we want, we can call that mourning. But our form of mourning is an attempt to turn loss into a reanimated gain---in imagination, thought, emotion and, importantly, symbolic expression. We make human meanings, and when we can share these meanings publicly it is constitutive of the formation of culture. Aristotle lived; Aristotle died: it is only our activity that transforms this change into loss and into a certain kind of gain.\n",
