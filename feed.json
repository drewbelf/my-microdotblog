New forms of life have come from unexpected places&mdash;from Athanasius at local councils, Benedict in the monasteries, Albertus and Thomas in the universities, Francis of Assisi in the lanes and roads, Ignatius alone with a penitent making <em>The Spiritual Exercises</em>, Xavier and Ricci out at the rim of the world, Acton and Newman in pamphlets and journals.</p>\n<p>These stirrings of life are not normally inspired, or even approved, by officials. Their leaders were held suspect, their teachings suppressed. Reformers could count themselves lucky if they were only silenced (like Abelard and Newman), condemned (like Erasmus and Wyclif), exiled by church authorities (like Athanasius and Chrysostom), or jailed by them (like St. John of the Cross and St. Ignatius of Loyola)&mdash;after all, St. Joan and Savonarola and John Hus were tortured and killed by them.

It’s sad to say, but God feels he has failed with certain societies, and I think that the passages from Isaiah and Saint Paul that we read today have become a very sad Salvadoran reality: “I looked for righteousness, and behold, murders! I looked for justice, and behold, laments!” ([Isa. 5:7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Is5.7)).\n",

We get attached to people and ideals, thoughts and projects that are themselves vulnerable. And we respond to that vulnerability by becoming active ourselves in making sense of what it all meant or will continue to mean. Other animals suffer loss; other animals grieve in complex ways. If we want, we can call that mourning. But our form of mourning is an attempt to turn loss into a reanimated gain&mdash;in imagination, thought, emotion and, importantly, symbolic expression.

				"content_text": "[Jonathan Lear](https://thepointmag.com/remarks/when-meghan-married-harry/):\n\n>Freud said that mourning is a \"great riddle,\" and its greatness partially consists in its not being the kind of riddle that gets solved. Mourning, he says, is \"one of those phenomena which cannot themselves be explained but to which other obscurities can be traced back.\" In essence, mourning is one of the ways we exercise our capacity for love. We get attached to people and ideals, thoughts and projects that are themselves vulnerable. And we respond to that vulnerability by becoming active ourselves in making sense of what it all meant or will continue to mean. Other animals suffer loss; other animals grieve in complex ways. If we want, we can call that mourning. But our form of mourning is an attempt to turn loss into a reanimated gain---in imagination, thought, emotion and, importantly, symbolic expression. We make human meanings, and when we can share these meanings publicly it is constitutive of the formation of culture. Aristotle lived; Aristotle died: it is only our activity that transforms this change into loss and into a certain kind of gain.\n",
