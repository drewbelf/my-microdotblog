This is quite a legitimate piece of borrowing and quite safe so long as it does not mislead us into thinking that the God we worship (or don&rsquo;t) is a god. We always do have to speak of our God with borrowed words; it is one of the special things about our God that there are no peculiarly appropriate words that belong to him, as with the language of carpentry or computer-speak.

This is quite a legitimate piece of borrowing and quite safe so long as it does not mislead us into thinking that the God we worship (or don't) is a god. We always do have to speak of our God with borrowed words; it is one of the special things about our God that there are no peculiarly appropriate words that belong to him, as with the language of carpentry or computer-speak.

In this sense, it is almost possible to say <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people\">the Wendat</a> had play chiefs and real freedoms, while most of us today have to make do with real chiefs and play freedoms.

My sense is that the political left in the United States has largely ceded talk of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to the right; you don&rsquo;t often (or, at least, I don&rsquo;t often) encounter arguments for leftist politics on the basis of freedom. But in fact, I think, the left does want &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; for people and their proposals can help facilitate such freedom. The difference is the left is less concerned with formal freedom (the concern of the right) than it is with substantive freedom.</p>\n<p>This is one piece of Graeber &amp; Wengrow&rsquo;s work that I really appreciate. They repeatedly stress that American indigenous peoples had a worldview closer to the contemporary US than European Enlightenment thinkers, because American indigenous peoples were concerned with (substantive) freedom. It&rsquo;s a clever rhetorical move: both the original inhabitants of the American continents and the present inhabitants of the American continents are interested in freedom; the difference is, in what that freedom consists.</p>\n",

Mutual aid ‚Äì what contemporary European observers often referred to as ‚Äòcommunism‚Äô ‚Äì was seen as the necessary condition for individual autonomy.\n\nI'm not sure if Graeber & Wengrow invent this distinction---I assume not---but distinguishing 'formal' freedoms from 'substantive' freedoms is helpful. My sense is that the political left in the United States has largely ceded talk of \"freedom\" to the right; you don't often (or, at least, I don't often) encounter arguments for leftist politics on the basis of freedom. But in fact, I think, the left does want \"freedom\" for people and their proposals can help facilitate such freedom. The difference is the left is less concerned with formal freedom (the concern of the right) than it is with substantive freedom.\n\nThis is one piece of Graeber & Wengrow's work that I really appreciate. They repeatedly stress that American indigenous peoples had a worldview closer to the contemporary US than European Enlightenment thinkers, because American indigenous peoples were concerned with (substantive) freedom. It's a clever rhetorical move: both the original inhabitants of the American continents and the present inhabitants of the American continents are interested in freedom; the difference is, in what that freedom consists.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Holy Week of any year&mdash;that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb‚Äîalways has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.</p>\n<p>I was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly‚Äîweekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.</p>\n<p>Laurel Marshall Potter‚Äîcolleague, friend, housemate‚Äîand I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community‚ÄîJews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals‚Äîgathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opening-prayer\">opening prayer</h2>\n<p>The way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God‚Äôs love. It is not God‚Äôs will that this injustice persist; it is not God‚Äôs will that the powerful remain so; it is not God‚Äôs will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus‚Äôs long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice.

Eager for profits, for consumer goods, for power, our culture readily sacrifices its poor, its elderly, its vulnerable to the market.

He has found small comforts along the way‚Äîthe tears of his mother, the strength of Simon, the cloth of Veronica‚Äîbut from here on out he is desperately alone. Our culture of death is a culture of isolation, for everyone dies alone. In that isolation is a spiritual desolation; apart from the fabric of our society, what meaning can our lives have?

				"content_text": "Holy Week of any year---that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb‚Äîalways has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.\n\nI was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly‚Äîweekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.\n\nLaurel Marshall Potter‚Äîcolleague, friend, housemate‚Äîand I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community‚ÄîJews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals‚Äîgathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.\n\n## opening prayer\nThe way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God‚Äôs love. It is not God‚Äôs will that this injustice persist; it is not God‚Äôs will that the powerful remain so; it is not God‚Äôs will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus‚Äôs long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice. This God walks the way of death in solidarity with all who suffer, as one who suffers, that they might suffer no more. The way ends on the cross in death‚Äîand by that very death, so ends death itself.\n\nV. El sacrificio verdadero es un coraz√≥n penitente.  \n‚Ñü.

				"content_html": "<p>Dear C‚Äî,<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>This past Sunday, on a cool and bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism‚Äîsomething in which you had no say and of which you have no memory‚Äîcreeping into your life in strange and unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all. I write this note in the hope it can offer some guidance here. Given the subject matter, this note is woefully short (despite its length!), but I hope it&rsquo;s helpful even still.</p>\n<p>The joys of life are many, and you&rsquo;ll come to learn these in time‚Äîriding a bike without training wheels, enjoying a meal you helped to prepare, reading a book your mom loved when she was your age. But when you have enjoyed all life has to offer and when you come to the end of your time on earth, there life&rsquo;s final obligation imposes itself. If you&rsquo;ll allow me to be blunt: all living things‚Äîhuman beings, animals, plants‚Äîmust die. Even nonliving things tend toward decay‚Äîgiven enough time, rocks break down into sand, stars explode into stardust, houses fall apart. This is an unfortunate, tragic, unsettling fact, but a fact nonetheless.</p>\n<p>But it is exactly because of this burden of death that your parents had you baptized. Baptism, you see, is a remedy to the death into which all living things are born. When you were baptized, water was poured over your head three times. This ritual symbolically‚Äîthough as Catholics we really ought to say &ldquo;sacramentally&rdquo;‚Äîputs the person being baptized to death; when she is lifted out of the baptismal font, she is raised to new life and made a member of the community founded by Christ and made up of all the baptized. This community‚Äîwhich we call &ldquo;the church&rdquo;‚Äîis freed by baptism from the reign of death and liberated into a reign of life. The freedom of the Christian is a freedom to live in and by the love of God‚Äîa love that is totally selfless and pure, concerned never for itself but always for the other.</p>\n<p>But just as being born naturally imposed upon you an obligation of death, so does being reborn sacramentally impose upon you an obligation. And as you would expect, the obligation baptism imposes is exactly the opposite of the one imposed by being born: the baptized are obliged to live!</p>\n<p>Christians have a peculiar understanding of what it is to live; peculiar, at least, according to how the rest of the world tends to think of what it is to live. For Christians to live, they must live for others‚Äîthey must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger, visit the imprisoned. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapter 25 of Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel</a>; or the Sermon on the Mount, found in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapters 5‚Äì7 of the same Gospel</a>.) And very often, Christians must inconvenience themselves to live in this way‚Äîthey must feed the hungry with their own food, clothe the naked with their own clothing, take the stranger into their own home, and visit the imprisoned on their own time. (St. Basil the Great says the unworn jacket in your closet rightfully belongs to the poor person who has no jacket!<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>) In this way, the life you received in your baptism is not so much yours as it is others', especially those most in need of your help.</p>\n<p>This obligation to live liberates us from the relentless rhythm of decay, that dirge of death according to which the rest of the world marches. Yet that baptismal obligation is not always pleasant‚Äîas I&rsquo;ve just suggested, it involves a personal cost to the Christian. You may find yourself with less food than you might otherwise have because you&rsquo;ve given some to your hungry neighbor, for example. What&rsquo;s more, you may find the task itself unpleasant. The hungry might lack table manners, or the poor decorum; the stranger&rsquo;s unusual customs might confuse you, and the prisoner&rsquo;s past might frighten. (<a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul\">St. Vincent de Paul has some really lovely words on this</a>; I remain forever haunted by his claim: &ldquo;It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.&rdquo; I have tears in my eyes as I recall my own failings in this respect.)</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another reason why we might shy away from baptism&rsquo;s obligation (and many, regrettably, do). The obligation of baptism to live runs directly contrary to the world and its designs. Unlike the white garment of life that the baptized wear, the world wears a death shroud and, wittingly or not, the world seeks to shroud more of the living in death. There&rsquo;s a reason, after all, that there are people without enough food, or too poor for clothing or a home, or lacking the freedom you enjoy. For the Christian to live her life for others, then, and for her to spread life in a world of death, is a subversive, even dangerous, undertaking. Indeed, the Christian seeks nothing less than liberation for all those bound by chains of death: liberation from hunger and poverty, and, yes, from the literal chains of the prison yard. The Christian seeks to undo, once and for all, the pattern of death in the world. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A47-55&amp;version=RSVCE\">Mary&rsquo;s Magnificat toward the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke</a>.)</p>\n<p>This is the sort of subversive, dangerous trouble Jesus got himself into. He came into a world of death preaching a message of life and love; he rejected the status quo and sought to undo the patterns of death that keep all, oppressors and oppressed alike, in chains. But the powers that be would not stand for it; they dealt with the problem in the only way they knew how, and they had him killed. Ironically, it was this very act of violence against life that assured the final victory of life over death (but that&rsquo;s another email for another time; in the meantime, you might take a look at <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A35-58&amp;version=RSVCE\">chapter 15 of Paul&rsquo;s First Letter to the Corinthians, especially verses 35 and following</a>).</p>\n<p>The life that your baptism demands of you is subversive: for this reason, the world may try to stop you, as it did Jesus. There will be some who take advantage of your generosity; there will be some who ridicule you for what they take to be foolishness on your part; there may even be some who commit acts of violence against you, so desperate will they be to stop the liberation you bring. I hope this is not the case for you; but I also hope that you take the demands of your baptism seriously, and that you live the life you have been freed to live. St. Irenaeus, one of the first theologians in the church&rsquo;s history, said that the glory of God is the human being fully alive. I hope you glorify God in all that you do by rejecting death and choosing to be fully alive for the liberation of yourself and of all.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you find yourself inspired by the liberating power of your baptism; perhaps you find yourself daunted at the prospect of such a demanding life; perhaps you find yourself vaguely annoyed at having spent so much time reading all this nonsense! (I hope it&rsquo;s not that last one, but I&rsquo;m aware it&rsquo;s at least a possibility.) However you respond to this‚Äîwhether positively, negatively, or even indifferently‚ÄîI hope you know there are people in your life who will always be available to talk to you about this. Your mom and dad rightly saw the good of baptism and so decided it was for you; your aunt V‚Äî and uncle B‚Äî as your godparents, have a special responsibility to guide you in matters of faith and spirituality; and I hope you&rsquo;ll think of me as someone you can talk to about this. I promise you&rsquo;ll always find in these people generous listeners, patient conversation partners, and loving family members.

 \nYour eyes are doves!‚Äù (1:15).  \nBut from those very eyes, he shrinks:  \n‚ÄúTurn your eyes away from me, for they disturb me‚Äù (6:5).  \nJacqueline sees me, and so I delight.  \nYet it is precisely because she sees me that I cower,  \nfor she misses nothing‚Äî  \nnot my shame, nor my sin.\n\nJacqueline,  \nin other words,  \nsees me not only as I am now‚Äî  \nsinful indeed and a poor excuse for a Christian‚Äî  \nbut also as I could be; rather, as I should be.  \nHer probing stare exhorts me to be who I am created to be‚Äî  \n[poor in spirit and meek](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A1-12a&version=NABRE),  \nhungering and thirsting for justice,  \nclean of heart and peacemaking.  \nSometimes she does this outright,  \ngently and charitably chiding me when I deserve it‚Äî  \nbut most times it is her modeling of Christian discipleship,  \nher lived embodiment of those beatitudes  \nthat points me away from sin and darkness  \nand toward righteousness and light.  \nSaint Francis of Assisi is attributed as saying,  \n‚ÄúPreach the Gospel always;  \nwhen necessary, use words.‚Äù  \nThough he surely uttered no such thing,  \nJacqueline lives that proverb ceaselessly.\n\nIndulge me still further.  \nMarriage,  \nas a sacrament in the Catholic sense,  \nis shaped and normed by the cross.  \nIn all sacraments, no less marriage,  \nwe die on the cross with Christ,  \nand with him leave behind an empty tomb.  \nIn our sacramental dying and rising  \nis anticipated our physical dying and rising.  \nEvery time a sinner submits to baptism‚Äôs watery grave,  \nevery time the one bloody sacrifice is celebrated  \nwith the unbloody words *hoc est corpus meum*,  \nevery time two persons die to their selves  \nand consent to the union in which they rise together as one,  \nDeath‚Äôs claim over us is broken.  \nThis is God‚Äôs wisdom, foolishness to the world,  \nthat by Death itself God should bring life.  \nRightly does the Apostle Paul‚Äîand do we‚Äî  \nrejoice with words mocking:  \n‚ÄúWhere, O Death, is your sting?‚Äù\n\nPut otherwise,  \nthe process of dying and rising in the sacraments  \nis nothing other than the process of entering into eternal life,  \nwherein the last enemy Death finally is defeated.  \nTo be married in this life is to be made ready  \nfor [the wedding-feast in the life to come](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+19&version=NABRE),  \nwhere we all shall be wedded to the Lamb whose victory the cross is.  \nIn my marital, sacramental life with Jacqueline,  \nand under the clear, precise, charitable, demanding gaze  \nby which Jacqueline attends to me,  \nI work out the salvation Christ has wrought.  \nI am not saved except for her love,  \nthat is to say her *attention*,  \na love and attention that reform me  \nnot in in her image or in mine,  \nbut in the image of the LORD.  \nThis is God‚Äôs providential plan for me;  \nthese are the means by which God,  \nin His mercy,  \nhas ordained that I shall be saved.  \nIt could not be otherwise.  \nWithout Jacqueline I turn my face from His face,  \nto my own peril;  \nwith her, I shall look upon the face of the LORD as a friend,  \nin life eternal.  \nI know not why God has entrusted her to my care‚Äî  \nfor I, as Jacqueline‚Äôs spouse, must do the same for her‚Äî  \nbut thanks be that God has seen fit to entrust me to hers.\n",
