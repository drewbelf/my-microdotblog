Jacqueline &amp; I decided to watch some Hitchcock in honor of Halloween at the end of the month. We&rsquo;ve seen a few Hitchcock already, but not <em>Rope</em>. I enjoyed it, though it&rsquo;s not my favorite of his (that remains <em>Psycho</em>). I love good, long scenes, &amp; Hitchcock&rsquo;s clever camera work to make the entire film seem like a single take really ratchets up the tension.</p>\n<p><em>Scream</em> (Wes Craven, 1996). I&rsquo;d seen bits of the recent <em>Scream</em> reboot on someone else&rsquo;s screen on an international flight a couple years ago, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve actually watched a <em>Scream</em> film start to finish. It was great! It was meta without being too in-your-face about it (with maybe an exception or two here or there), &amp; there were some unexpected resonances with <em>Rope</em> (chiefly in the homoerotic subtext between Billy &amp; Stu). The opening sequence is genuinely frightening, &amp; killing off Drew Barrymore at the very beginning is brilliant. I have little interest in the rest of the franchise, but this was a good one.</p>\n<p><em>The Greatest Showman</em> (Michael Gracey, 2017). One of my students watched my favorite movie, <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, &amp; insisted I watch this movie in return. I&rsquo;ll confess, I didn&rsquo;t love it. The music really didn&rsquo;t do anything, and the story felt pretty tepid (surprising, considering the actual history of P.T. Barnum&rsquo;s life).</p>\n<p><em>The Birds</em> (Alfred Hitchcock, 1963). Another Hitchcock in honor of Halloween month. Amazing how threatening Hitchcock makes birds seem&mdash;the scene as the birds gather outside the schoolhouse!&mdash;&amp; how he used <em>real birds</em> for almost the entire movie.</p>\n<p><em>A Serious Man</em> (Joel Coen &amp; Ethan Coen, 2009). I watched this movie as a candidate for the <a href=\"https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/10/30/ive-been-spending.html\">theology &amp; film course I&rsquo;m designing</a>. I think it&rsquo;ll make the syllabus. The film obviously engages the book of Job but also has some pretty significant differences. I think it will make for great discussion, to bring this film into dialogue with its source material.</p>\n<p><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (Wes Craven, 1984). Another Wes Craven to finish out October. I thought this was pretty good, though I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much as <em>Scream</em>. It had some creepy sequences but I think I really only jumped once or twice (&amp; I tend to be very jumpy during scary movies). I liked Nancy&rsquo;s character. That last sequence was very confusing though (&amp; apparently an addition at the insistence of the producer). I&rsquo;d like to see <em>Wes Craven&rsquo;s New Nightmare</em> now.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d hoped to see <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> this month, but it was a very busy month at work.

I thought this was pretty good, though I didn't enjoy it as much as *Scream*. It had some creepy sequences but I think I really only jumped once or twice (& I tend to be very jumpy during scary movies). I liked Nancy's character. That last sequence was very confusing though (& apparently an addition at the insistence of the producer). I'd like to see *Wes Craven's New Nightmare* now.\n\nI'd hoped to see *Killers of the Flower Moon* this month, but it was a very busy month at work. I'm planning to see it in the next week or so.\n",

Afterwards they will write a reflective essay in which they discuss their experience of service in connection with key themes &amp; ideas from the course. I was inspired to work this project into my course by my colleague, who had used service learning in the past, &amp; students responded well to the project last semester. This semester I&rsquo;ve worked to more fully integrate the project into my course, mainly by orienting all the other writing assignments in the course to the service learning project.</p>\n<p>Early in the semester, students will write a short essay articulating their understanding of &ldquo;Franciscan service,&rdquo; on the basis of a couple of readings we&rsquo;ll discuss in class (including selections of Pope Francis&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html\">Fratelli tutti</a></em>). This writing assignment will ask them to consider the difference between service &amp; solidarity, &amp; how they might embody solidarity in their own acts of service. This early writing assignment will help students begin to think about service in a Franciscan key, &amp; what they might want to do for their service project. (We&rsquo;ll also have time in class to brainstorm ideas &amp; begin planning projects.)</p>\n<p>Later on in the semester students will complete an in-class positionality mapping exercise (I learned a lot about this from <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1609406919870075\">Danielle Jacobson&rsquo;s &amp; Nida Mustafa&rsquo;s paper on social identity mapping</a>), which will form the basis of their second writing assignment. I don&rsquo;t ask students to share with me anything about their social position they&rsquo;re not comfortable sharing, but I do ask them to reflect in writing on how their social position informs their own particular worldview. That includes possible blind spots they may have as a consequence of their social position; that also includes a unique perspective or insight about the world they have thanks to their social position. My hope&mdash;&amp; I&rsquo;ll be explicit about this in class&mdash;is that students will think about the position <em>from which</em> they engage in service. What is it about their social location that puts them in a position to do service at all? How do their intersecting social positions inform they kind of good they want to do in their community?</p>\n<p>Then, in the latter half of the semester, students will write a couple short essays on Franciscan values. I&rsquo;ve already identified most of the possible values (e.g., non-possessiveness, fraternal living, universal kinship, peacemaking, etc.); students will choose one, find a quotation from Francis or Clare to illustrate it, &amp; then explain the value. These will come into play when students are reflecting on their experience in the service learning project.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the end of the semester students write a reflective essay drawing on their experience completing the service learning project. The reflective essay has a few parts to it. I&rsquo;ll ask them to think about to what extent their service learning project met the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; of Franciscan service they set in their first writing assignment. Students won&rsquo;t be graded on how &ldquo;Franciscan&rdquo; their project was; rather, I want students to think about how service does &amp; does not allow for the &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;&mdash;the change of social position&mdash;that Francis &amp; Clare lived in their own time.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll also ask students to think about how their social position may have shaped their experience of doing service. The goal here is that putting service in the context of one&rsquo;s social position will discourage the &ldquo;it felt so good to help someone&rdquo; attitude toward service, which I worry is patronizing &amp; shortcircuits questions about why we live in a world where such service is needed. Instead, I&rsquo;d like students to think more critically about themselves &amp; society&mdash;what about their privilege positions them to do service like this? How might students choose to live in ways that counteract the societal arrangements that marginalize or oppress people?</p>\n<p>Students will further reflect on Franciscan values in connection with their experience of service. They might use what we learned in the classroom to analyze &amp; interpret their experience, or they might use their experience to shed new light on the ideas learned &amp; discussed in class.</p>\n<p>The reflective essay, then, draws upon each of the previous writing assignments while asking students to rethink some of their earlier thoughts in light of the service experience. I hope this project gives a clear throughline to the course as a whole; I hope, too, that it conveys to students the nature of learning as cumulative &amp; always needing revision. (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a more elegant way to say that.) Basically: knowledge&mdash;in all its forms&mdash;builds &amp; often requires us to adjust what we previously thought about the world.</p>\n<p>While I&rsquo;ve done this service learning project before, this is the first time I&rsquo;m teaching it as a fully integrated component of the course.

My sections of ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis &amp; Clare‚Äù tend to focus on the moral &amp; spiritual challenge posed by climate change; I have found this issue is rarely far from students‚Äô minds, &amp; Francis &amp; Clare offer some particularly apt resources to engage this issue.</p>\n<p>Consider, for example, ideas of fraternity &amp; kinship. What obligations do we humans have to the natural world, if <a href=\"https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-canticle-of-the-creatures/129-fa-ed-1-page-113\">nonhuman creatures are sister &amp; brother to us as Francis sang</a>? How have humans failed in that obligation, particularly in the wake of the industrial revolution &amp; the widespread environmental degradation of our day? If God is praised through all God‚Äôs creatures, what does the loss of biodiversity mean for creation‚Äôs capacity to reflect the depths of God‚Äôs goodness &amp; beauty? How should human beings who enjoy some degree of privilege respond with mercy &amp; compassion to <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\">the cry of the earth &amp; the cry of the poor</a>? We ask these &amp; related questions in light of our study of Francis &amp; Clare.</p>\n<p>The goal of ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis &amp; Clare‚Äù is not just to know a little bit about the personalities behind the mission &amp; values of SBU; the goal is also to consider how Francis &amp; Clare continue to speak to people of good will today, urging us to patterns of life that prefer mercy to cruelty, compassion to apathy, generosity to wealth, justice to oppression. Whether they are heard today depends as much on the students as it does the instructor, but if we cannot hear Francis &amp; Clare in their own day we certainly cannot hear them in ours.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>These remarks were delivered at the 2023 Association of Franciscan Colleges &amp; Universities Symposium, on a panel titled <a href=\"https://afcu2023.siena.edu/session/illuminating-franciscan-sources-in-the-classroom-francis-clare-and-beyond/\">Illuminating Franciscan Sources in the Classroom: Francis, Clare, &amp; Beyond</a>.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Dominic Monti, ofm, offers a helpful overview of these factors in his <em>Francis &amp; His Brothers: A Popular History of the Franciscan Friars</em> (St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2009).&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>On Francis&rsquo;s understanding of penance, see Michael F.

The twenty-first century United States seems worlds apart from thirteenth-century Italy, & we cannot understand Francis & Clare without understanding their world. Francis & Clare are themselves very strange people‚Äîstrange not only for their preference of poverty to riches & asceticism to comfort, but also for their reasons for those preferences. & given the gap that yawns between our day & theirs, it‚Äôs not always immediately clear why people today should care about this pair of strange medieval Christians.\n\nOr, so it would seem.

Allow me to describe, in broad strokes, my approach in teaching ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis & Clare.‚Äù The course, & my remarks today, unfold across three movements. First, we must pay attention to Francis & Clare‚Äôs own context; second, we must pay attention to Francis & Clare‚Äôs words & deeds; third, we must pay attention to our own context, words, & deeds.\n\n## We first pay attention to Francis & Clare‚Äôs own context.\n\nWe have to begin with the world into which Francis & Clare were born. That world includes some theological ideas that medieval Christians took for granted & that find peculiar expression in Francis & Clare‚Äôs lives & writings: ideas like creation, sin, the kingdom of God, [the incompatibility of living for God & living for money](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19%3A16-26&version=NRSVCE), the redeeming suffering & death of Jesus, martyrdom & monasticism. But Francis & Clare‚Äôs world was not just religious but also economic, social, & cultural, & these factors played as much a role in shaping Francis & Clare as did their religion.[^2] They witnessed a growing disparity in wealth between the haves & have-nots; they lived through rapid urbanization & a spiritual crisis brought about by this new form of isolated living; they were grieved at the marginalization of the sick & the poor from community life.\n\n[^2]: Dominic Monti, ofm, offers a helpful overview of these factors in his *Francis & His Brothers: A Popular History of the Franciscan Friars* (St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2009).\n\nOnly with some sense of this context can we begin to understand the meaning of Francis & Clare‚Äôs words & gestures. In setting this context, too, students can begin to draw connections between Francis & Clare‚Äôs world & our own. Wealth & income inequality are not, after all, unfamiliar phenomena to us today; neither is social isolation brought about by new technologies & societal circumstances.\n\n## Second, we pay attention to Francis & Clare‚Äôs own words & deeds,\n\nespecially how these words & deeds respond to their particular historical & cultural moment. We begin by looking at ‚Äòpenance‚Äô, for this is the decisive impulse of Francis‚Äôs life. [As he reflects on his life in his *Testament* Francis narrates his own religious conversion](https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-testament/140-fa-ed-1-page-124) with these words: ‚ÄúThe Lord gave me, Brother Francis, thus to begin doing penance in this way: for when I was in sin, it seemed too bitter for me to see those suffering leprosy. & the Lord himself led me among them, & I showed mercy to them.‚Äù This penitential orientation, which entails rejecting whatever alienates & dehumanizes the human fraternity & instead practicing compassion & mercy for all God‚Äôs creatures, is the defining feature of Francis‚Äôs outlook & behavior.[^3] Here the benefit of knowing Francis‚Äôs context begins to show forth: without understanding how Assisi stigmatized & marginalized those with leprosy, it is impossible to understand with any depth the significance of Francis‚Äôs life of penance.\n\n[^3]: On Francis's understanding of penance, see Michael F. Cusato, ofm, ‚ÄúTo Do Penance / *Facere Poenitentiam*,‚Äù *The Cord* 57, no. 1 (2007): 3‚Äì24.\n\nPoverty is another major theme in this part of the course; here again contextualizing Francis & Clare helps illuminate this supremely countercultural practice.[^3a] Francis & Clare refuse to handle money not just out of gospel fidelity or trust in God, but as a gesture responding directly to the violence wrought by an emerging money economy.[^4] Their embrace of poverty is something of a protest: against the ascendancy of the transactional over the personal in human relationship, & against the evaluation of persons (or, more distressingly for Francis & Clare, the de-valuation of persons) based on economic status.[^5]\n\n[^3a]: William Short, ofm, in his *Poverty & Joy: The Franciscan Tradition* (Orbis Books, 1999) helps explain Francis's practice of poverty & Clare's role as the \"first interpreter\" of Francis. This book is a helpful resource also because it considers not only Francis & Clare as founders of the Franciscan tradition but also as that tradition is received in subsequent generations of Franciscans.\n\n[^4]: David Flood, ofm, helps explain some features of this money economy & how it was used to oppress and further impoverish the already impoverished in ‚ÄúFranciscans and Money,‚Äù *Haversack* 4, no. 2 (1980): 12‚Äì21.\n\n[^5]: See again Cusato, \"To Do Penance,\" 13‚Äì15, 16‚Äì18.\n\nWe consider other themes in Francis & Clare‚Äôs lives & writings, too‚Äîfraternal living & universal kinship,[^6] peacemaking,[^7] prayer & contemplation,[^8] to name a few. Students particularly enjoy discussing how Francis & Clare each navigate church authorities, in often unexpectedly subversive ways.[^9]\n\n[^6]: See Marie Dennis, et al., *St. Francis and the Foolishness of God* (Orbis Books, 2015), 39‚Äì59; & Andr√© Vauchez, \"Francis, Nature, and the World,\" in *Francis of Assisi: The Life and Afterlife of a Medieval Saint* (translated by Michael Cusato; Yale University Press, 2012).\n\n[^7]: Steven J. McMichael, ofm, ‚ÄúFrancis and the Encounter with the Sultan (1219),‚Äù in *The Cambridge Companion to Francis of Assisi*, ed. Michael J. P. Robson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 127‚Äì42.\n\n[^8]: Short, *Poverty & Joy*, 81‚Äì92; & Dennis, et al., *St. Francis and the Foolishness of God*, 147‚Äì69.\n\n[^9]: Beth Lynn, osc, \"Clare of Assisi and Conscientious Objection,\" *The Cord* 48, no. 4 (1998): 191‚Äì200.\n\n## Third, we pay attention to our own context, words, & deeds.\n\nThe hope here is that students will read the ‚Äúsigns of the times,‚Äù as it were, in light of the lives & values of Francis & Clare. My sections of ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis & Clare‚Äù tend to focus on the moral & spiritual challenge posed by climate change; I have found this issue is rarely far from students‚Äô minds, & Francis & Clare offer some particularly apt resources to engage this issue.\n\nConsider, for example, ideas of fraternity & kinship. What obligations do we humans have to the natural world, if [nonhuman creatures are sister & brother to us as Francis sang](https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-canticle-of-the-creatures/129-fa-ed-1-page-113)? How have humans failed in that obligation, particularly in the wake of the industrial revolution & the widespread environmental degradation of our day? If God is praised through all God‚Äôs creatures, what does the loss of biodiversity mean for creation‚Äôs capacity to reflect the depths of God‚Äôs goodness & beauty? How should human beings who enjoy some degree of privilege respond with mercy & compassion to [the cry of the earth & the cry of the poor](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html)? We ask these & related questions in light of our study of Francis & Clare.\n\nThe goal of ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis & Clare‚Äù is not just to know a little bit about the personalities behind the mission & values of SBU; the goal is also to consider how Francis & Clare continue to speak to people of good will today, urging us to patterns of life that prefer mercy to cruelty, compassion to apathy, generosity to wealth, justice to oppression. Whether they are heard today depends as much on the students as it does the instructor, but if we cannot hear Francis & Clare in their own day we certainly cannot hear them in ours.\n",

Everyone can now know that love is the ultimate, that it is stronger than death, stronger than hatred and injustice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The people in whom Jesus realized the kingdom of God&mdash;in his preaching &amp; in his miracles&mdash;experienced the kingdom of God as <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+9%3A1-8&amp;version=RSVCE\">a forgiveness of sins</a>, that is to say, as an encounter with God&rsquo;s abundant, indeed unlimited, mercy. To be forgiven of one&rsquo;s sins is to know oneself to be loved. God&rsquo;s love, in other words, knows no limits and is available even to those considered religiously undesirable: sinners &amp; taxcollectors, lepers &amp; gentiles.</p>\n<p>This experience of an unconditioned love is an experience of freedom. To know that you are loved beyond measure &amp; apart from any merit frees you to love of others&mdash;if you are loved by a love made available through the life &amp; death of Jesus to even the worst among sinners (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A15&amp;version=RSVCE\">1 Timothy 1:15</a>), then there is no reason not to love your neighbors. There is no need for egoism or worldly striving, for self-interest or status; there is no need to convince yourself that you are loved for your accomplishments or achievements. You are loved, even apart from all that. Resting in the assurance of God&rsquo;s love, then, one can stop trying to convince others (&amp; yourself) that you are lovable. To know oneself to be loved is to be freed from worrying about oneself so that one can <a href=\"https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2019/05/18/that-attention-is.html\">turn one&rsquo;s attention</a> to others.</p>\n<p>But this individual experience of love has effects not only on the individual or an individual&rsquo;s interpersonal relationships. It brings about a new order to society: rather than the status quo of getting ahead, of making money, of winning status &amp; privilege (&amp; consequently reducing the status &amp; privilege of others), a society that is built upon love for all can be a society that seeks the good of all. You can make a new start at your life, focused not on self-aggrandizement but on the flourishing of another (&amp; yourself).</p>\n<p>How does all this justify the claim that love is stronger even than death? Elsewhere Kasper writes that &ldquo;love, as it were, entraps evil and by doing so it overcomes it and creates the possibility of a new start.&rdquo; I think that&rsquo;s relevant here. To respond to evil with love, to cruelty with kindness, to violence with peace, forecloses the possibility of evil. The evil-doer&mdash;the enemy&mdash;can keep doing evil, of course. Often they do. But in refusing to respond in kind, the Christian puts a stop to evil. The enemy no longer is enemy; evil no longer saps the good of its goodness. When Jesus is unjustly put to death &amp; refuses to respond in kind, the Father vindicates Jesus&rsquo;s love even unto death by raising him on the third day. Love has the final say; love restores the world to order.</p>\n<p>Every time I try to talk about this&mdash;Jesus&rsquo;s message of love as the answer to evil &amp; death&mdash;with my students, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that this message of love is so cringe or corny or clich√© (like the little speech John Mayer spliced into the middle of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65hqZpwJAbI\">his otherwise impeccable performance of &ldquo;Bold as Love&rdquo;</a>). Really? Love? It just seems so obviously inadequate. But that reaction is because we&mdash;&amp; here I mean my students as well as myself&mdash;don&rsquo;t fully grasp how radical this message of love really is. It cuts so deeply against the foundations of society that we have a hard time making sense of it; we have to attenuate it beyond recognition so that it stands as only faint shadow of what Jesus meant when he spoke of the love of his <em>abba</em>. After all, Jesus&rsquo;s love led him to Golgotha, just as the love of the martyrs since Jesus&mdash;Perpetua &amp; Felicity, Joan of Arc, Martin Luther King Jr., √ìscar Romero, &amp; countless others whose names we don&rsquo;t know&mdash;have likewise lead to their deaths. Yet it is in their dying that the ultimate meaning of love &amp; its victory is revealed.</p>\n",

There is no need for egoism or worldly striving, for self-interest or status; there is no need to convince yourself that you are loved for your accomplishments or achievements. You are loved, even apart from all that. Resting in the assurance of God's love, then, one can stop trying to convince others (& yourself) that you are lovable. To know oneself to be loved is to be freed from worrying about oneself so that one can [turn one's attention](https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2019/05/18/that-attention-is.html) to others.\n\nBut this individual experience of love has effects not only on the individual or an individual's interpersonal relationships. It brings about a new order to society: rather than the status quo of getting ahead, of making money, of winning status & privilege (& consequently reducing the status & privilege of others), a society that is built upon love for all can be a society that seeks the good of all. You can make a new start at your life, focused not on self-aggrandizement but on the flourishing of another (& yourself).\n\nHow does all this justify the claim that love is stronger even than death? Elsewhere Kasper writes that \"love, as it were, entraps evil and by doing so it overcomes it and creates the possibility of a new start.\" I think that's relevant here. To respond to evil with love, to cruelty with kindness, to violence with peace, forecloses the possibility of evil. The evil-doer---the enemy---can keep doing evil, of course. Often they do. But in refusing to respond in kind, the Christian puts a stop to evil. The enemy no longer is enemy; evil no longer saps the good of its goodness. When Jesus is unjustly put to death & refuses to respond in kind, the Father vindicates Jesus's love even unto death by raising him on the third day. Love has the final say; love restores the world to order.\n\nEvery time I try to talk about this---Jesus's message of love as the answer to evil & death---with my students, I can't help but feel that this message of love is so cringe or corny or clich√© (like the little speech John Mayer spliced into the middle of [his otherwise impeccable performance of \"Bold as Love\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65hqZpwJAbI)). Really? Love? It just seems so obviously inadequate. But that reaction is because we---& here I mean my students as well as myself---don't fully grasp how radical this message of love really is. It cuts so deeply against the foundations of society that we have a hard time making sense of it; we have to attenuate it beyond recognition so that it stands as only faint shadow of what Jesus meant when he spoke of the love of his *abba*. After all, Jesus's love led him to Golgotha, just as the love of the martyrs since Jesus---Perpetua & Felicity, Joan of Arc, Martin Luther King Jr., √ìscar Romero, & countless others whose names we don't know---have likewise lead to their deaths. Yet it is in their dying that the ultimate meaning of love & its victory is revealed.\n",
