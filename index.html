<p>I admire the aim here: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&rsquo;s life, death, &amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp; while I don&rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&rsquo;s life (natal &amp; risen) &amp; his death don&rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.</p>
<p>More frustrating is the hostility toward Anselm of Canterbury &amp; his satisfaction theory. It seems to me Johnson could have attended more carefully to Anselm&rsquo;s method (<em>remoto Christi</em> does not necessarily mean <em>remoto fidei</em>) &amp; the scope of <em>Cur Deus homo</em>; I also think her treatment of satisfaction theory actually reads later theories (especially penal substitutionary atonement) back into Anselm. I&rsquo;m not sure what accounts for this superficial reading; perhaps engaging more up-to-date scholarship could have helped better situate Anselm in his proper context (more Benedictine monastic than feudal).</p>
<p>The treatment of Anselm is disappointing not only because it misrepresents him, but also because I actually think Anselm could be a resource for Johnson&rsquo;s project here. His concerns are not identical to hers, of course&mdash;we wouldn&rsquo;t expect them to be&mdash;but the themes of mercy and cosmic setting-aright are decisive for Anselm. I think a more generous and productive reading of Anselm is possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307267450?title=The+Road&amp;author=Cormac+McCarthy&amp;cover_id=89618">Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains</a>. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.</p>

			 <p>Zena Hitz on <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/the-grace-of-wholeheartedness">reununciation &amp; happiness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feared that if I were not in charge of my happiness, I would not attain it. Such fears were fed by my relative wealth and success. Wealth is dangerous: it provides the illusion of dominance over one’s surroundings. If I can replace something in my household if I simply don’t like its looks, if I can order a car and driver whenever my feet are tired, or fly to Rome whenever I crave pasta carbonara, or purchase a warm blanket at the first chill of winter, I develop illusions about myself. Even worse, if I can transform a landscape with my enterprise, whether by building or by destruction, if I have the power of life or death over others, I begin to imagine that I am a sort of being different from what I really am. I begin to imagine myself as a godlike being who makes reality when I open my mouth or raise a single finger. Yet ultimately my control is extremely limited, as Oedipus learned, by the luck of circumstances and by inescapable forms of human ignorance. Wealth can seem to make these contingencies shrink, but they cannot be eliminated. Dependence and blindness are core realities for every human being.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me draw upon the register of contemporary philosophy to explain: if Heidegger is correct that the key to a thinker&rsquo;s ideas lies in &ldquo;that which, in what is said, remains unsaid&rdquo; (<em>das im Sagen Ungesagte</em>)&mdash;in unarticulated, sometimes even unthought presuppositions underpinning an entire intellectual edifice&mdash;then it may not only be legitimate but crucial to read a work from its margins, from between its lines.</p>

I wish I had read it instead of listening to the audiobook. The audiobook narrator read in a very performative style, almost like it was a stage production, at times even shouting the words. That approach may have suited Yuknavitch&rsquo;s writing style, but I found it consistently distracting and occasionally even irritating.</p>

			 <p>I know it&rsquo;s really not that complicated but for whatever reason I can never keep track of where &amp; how the numbering of the Psalter in the Masoretic text differs from that in the Septuagint. Whenever I come up against a medieval author citing a psalm &amp; want to check the reference, I always end up looking up the cited psalm, &amp; the psalms immediately after &amp; before.</p>

			 <p>Dorothy Day <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/scandal-works-mercy">on the scandalous character of the works of mercy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The works of mercy are a wonderful stimulus to our growth in faith as well as in love. Our faith is taxed to the utmost and so grows through this strain put upon it. It is pruned again and again, and springs up bearing much fruit. For anyone starting to live literally the words of the Fathers of the Church, “the bread you retain belongs to the hungry, the dress you lock up is the property of the naked,” “what is superfluous for one’s need is to be regarded as plunder if one retains it for one’s self,” there is always a trial ahead. “Our faith, more precious than gold, must be tried as though by fire.” Here is a letter we received today. “I took a gentleman seemingly in need of spiritual and temporal guidance into my home on a Sunday afternoon. Let him have a nap on my bed, went through the want ads with him, made coffee and sandwiches for him, and when he left, I found my wallet had gone also.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her words call to mind, for me, the words attributed to St. Vincent de Paul (I have not been able to verify whether they are indeed his):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will find out that Charity is a heavy burden to carry, heavier than the kettle of soup and the full basket. But you will keep your gentleness and your smile. It is not enough to give soup and bread. This the rich can do. You are the servant of the poor, always smiling and good-humored. They are your masters, terribly sensitive and exacting master you will see and the uglier and the dirtier they will be, the more unjust and insulting, the more love you must give them. It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite exchanges in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780061947353">C. S. Lewis&rsquo;s <em>The Great Divorce</em></a>. Here the &ldquo;Big Man&rdquo; (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life&mdash;ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven&mdash;&amp; how Heaven is therefore his &ldquo;by rights.&rdquo; Len (his guide to Heaven &amp; apparently a former employee of the Big Man&rsquo;s) keeps trying to dissuade him from thinking about Heaven as a matter of deserts.</p>
<p>This is something I encounter, semester after semester, in my students’ thinking about Heaven &amp; Hell: it must be a matter of what one deserves. But as Len himself notes, no one in Heaven gets what they deserve: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad as that. I haven&rsquo;t got my rights, or I should not be here. You will not get yours either. You&rsquo;ll get something far better. Never fear.&rdquo; No one is really good enough to actually <em>deserve</em> the joys of Heaven; this is not so much a comment on the smallness of human goodness as a comment on the largeness of Heaven&rsquo;s joys.</p>
<p>If Heaven is a matter of being eternally enfolded into the love of God&mdash;into the love that <em>is</em> God&mdash;then it cannot be the case that Heaven is a matter of just deserts. That&rsquo;s not only because humans have a self-destructive tendency to turn from love when they encounter it (Len again: &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t a decent man and you didn&rsquo;t do your best. We none of us were and none of us did. Lord bless you, it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;), but also because <em>that&rsquo;s not how love works</em>. Love is not something earned or merited: it is a gift, freely given &amp; gratefully received.</p>
<p>To think about Heaven as something someone earns&mdash;as a reward for good behavior&mdash;is to go about it all wrong. But if we think about Heaven instead as God&rsquo;s offer of self in love, well, now we&rsquo;re on to something.</p>

			 <p>I love this move Pope Francis makes in his interpretation of the parable of the good Samaritan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus asks us to be present to those in need of help, regardless of whether or not they belong to our social group. In this case, the Samaritan <em>became a neighbour</em> to the wounded Judean. By approaching and making himself present, he crossed all cultural and historical barriers. Jesus concludes the parable by saying: “Go and do likewise” (<em>Lk</em> 10:37). In other words, he challenges us to put aside all differences and, in the face of suffering, to draw near to others with no questions asked. I should no longer say that I have neighbours to help, but that I must myself be a neighbour to others. (<em><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html">Fratelli tutti</a></em>, §81)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780567077592">Walter Kasper</a> on kingdom of God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when the ultimate source of all reality, God&rsquo;s love, re-establishes itself and comes to power, the world is restored to order and salvation. Because each individual can feel himself accepted and approved without reserve, he becomes free to live with others. The coming of the Kingdom of God&rsquo;s love therefore means the salvation of the world as a whole and the salvation of every individual. Everyone can now know that love is the ultimate, that it is stronger than death, stronger than hatred and injustice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people in whom Jesus realized the kingdom of God&mdash;in his preaching &amp; in his miracles&mdash;experienced the kingdom of God as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+9%3A1-8&amp;version=RSVCE">a forgiveness of sins</a>, that is to say, as an encounter with God&rsquo;s abundant, indeed unlimited, mercy. To be forgiven of one&rsquo;s sins is to know oneself to be loved. God&rsquo;s love, in other words, knows no limits and is available even to those considered religiously undesirable: sinners &amp; taxcollectors, lepers &amp; gentiles.</p>
<p>This experience of an unconditioned love is an experience of freedom. To know that you are loved beyond measure &amp; apart from any merit frees you to love of others&mdash;if you are loved by a love made available through the life &amp; death of Jesus to even the worst among sinners (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A15&amp;version=RSVCE">1 Timothy 1:15</a>), then there is no reason not to love your neighbors. There is no need for egoism or worldly striving, for self-interest or status; there is no need to convince yourself that you are loved for your accomplishments or achievements. You are loved, even apart from all that. Resting in the assurance of God&rsquo;s love, then, one can stop trying to convince others (&amp; yourself) that you are lovable. To know oneself to be loved is to be freed from worrying about oneself so that one can <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2019/05/18/that-attention-is.html">turn one&rsquo;s attention</a> to others.</p>
<p>But this individual experience of love has effects not only on the individual or an individual&rsquo;s interpersonal relationships. It brings about a new order to society: rather than the status quo of getting ahead, of making money, of winning status &amp; privilege (&amp; consequently reducing the status &amp; privilege of others), a society that is built upon love for all can be a society that seeks the good of all. You can make a new start at your life, focused not on self-aggrandizement but on the flourishing of another (&amp; yourself).</p>
<p>How does all this justify the claim that love is stronger even than death? Elsewhere Kasper writes that &ldquo;love, as it were, entraps evil and by doing so it overcomes it and creates the possibility of a new start.&rdquo; I think that&rsquo;s relevant here. To respond to evil with love, to cruelty with kindness, to violence with peace, forecloses the possibility of evil. The evil-doer&mdash;the enemy&mdash;can keep doing evil, of course. Often they do. But in refusing to respond in kind, the Christian puts a stop to evil. The enemy no longer is enemy; evil no longer saps the good of its goodness. When Jesus is unjustly put to death &amp; refuses to respond in kind, the Father vindicates Jesus&rsquo;s love even unto death by raising him on the third day. Love has the final say; love restores the world to order.</p>
<p>Every time I try to talk about this&mdash;Jesus&rsquo;s message of love as the answer to evil &amp; death&mdash;with my students, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that this message of love is so cringe or corny or cliché (like the little speech John Mayer spliced into the middle of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65hqZpwJAbI">his otherwise impeccable performance of &ldquo;Bold as Love&rdquo;</a>). Really? Love? It just seems so obviously inadequate. But that reaction is because we&mdash;&amp; here I mean my students as well as myself&mdash;don&rsquo;t fully grasp how radical this message of love really is. It cuts so deeply against the foundations of society that we have a hard time making sense of it; we have to attenuate it beyond recognition so that it stands as only faint shadow of what Jesus meant when he spoke of the love of his <em>abba</em>. After all, Jesus&rsquo;s love led him to Golgotha, just as the love of the martyrs since Jesus&mdash;Perpetua &amp; Felicity, Joan of Arc, Martin Luther King Jr., Óscar Romero, &amp; countless others whose names we don&rsquo;t know&mdash;have likewise lead to their deaths. Yet it is in their dying that the ultimate meaning of love &amp; its victory is revealed.</p>

			 <p>Interesting series on apophatic &amp; cataphatic theology over at Theopolis. <a href="https://theopolisinstitute.com/conversations/the-eclipse-of-the-word-five-theses-on-apophaticism/">Timothy Troutner suggests</a> a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; apophaticism (represented especially in so-called grammatical thomists like McCabe &amp; in post-Heidegerrean philosophers like Marion) endangers the possibility of revelation &amp; christology. I find myself more sympathetic to <a href="https://theopolisinstitute.com/conversations/fear-desire-and-perplexity">Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt&rsquo;s response</a> (not exactly a disagreement with Troutner, though certainly a defense of McCabe&rsquo;s grammatical thomism), but I&rsquo;ll have to think more carefully about Troutner&rsquo;s concerns, especially since I myself am inclined to the sort of apophaticism grammatical thomism represents.</p>

			 <p>Walter Kasper on theodicy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the terrible experiences of the twentieth century the question arises unavoidably: How can God stand by and watch all this? How could he allow it? There is no easy answer to this question. Like Job we can only keep silence (cf. Job 42). The christology of the Church Fathers shows the direction in which to look for a possible answer. It starts from the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Philippians. There Paul speaks of <em>kenosis</em>, that is, the self-emptying of one who was in the form of God (Phil. 2.5&ndash;11). On the basis of this saying, the Church Fathers developed their <em>kenosis</em> christology. It says: God did not just stand by and watch human misery. He does not sit motionlessly enthroned over a world full of horror. He himself also became involved in humiliation, suffering and death, even unjust death, in order to be near us in such extreme situations, so that where all hope is lost he can give us hope and a share in his divine life.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/04/09/a-few-things.html">A Few Things You Would Read If You Wanted to Figure Out What I Get Out of Christianity</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/04/09/a-few-things.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-04-10 14:54:53 -0400">Apr 10, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Inspired by <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/a-few-things-you-would-read-if-you">Phil Christman&rsquo;s recent post of the same name</a>, here&rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what <em>I</em> get out of Christianity.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Christman&rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It’s extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone’s. It reflects where I sit in a set of social structures. Either God came and met me there, despite the badness of those structures, or God didn’t, but if God did, this was how, or part of it. Either way, I make no apology. It’s my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an effort to limit myself, I&rsquo;m going to try to copy Christman&rsquo;s basic form: he includes a literary classic, a work from a spiritual writer, an essay, &amp; a classic in Christian apologetics. I, not Christman, have identified these categories, &amp; I realize his list could have been categorized differently. But this keeps things manageable for me, at least for now.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250082244"><em>Silence: A Novel</em>, by Shūsaku Endō</a>. What is it to be a Christian in the face of suffering, both your own &amp; another&rsquo;s? What is it to be a Christian when all you hear is God&rsquo;s silence? These are the questions that occupy this book. Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s film adaptation is excellent, too, though no substitute for the book. (Honestly, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812974263"><em>Les Misérables</em></a> probably better belongs in this category of &ldquo;literary classic&rdquo;&mdash;its treatment of themes of justice &amp; mercy in the personal &amp; social lives of Christians has had a deep effect on me, though I can hardly recommend a 650,000+ word novel on a list like this.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307589521"><em>Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</em>, by Thomas Merton</a>. Most anything by Thomas Merton could fit into this spot, but I&rsquo;ve chosen <em>Conjectures</em> because I think it shows how Merton weds the contemplative &amp; the active especially later in his life. He wanders a bit in this book &amp; that can make it difficult to follow where he&rsquo;s going, but it&rsquo;s nevertheless a rewarding read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He Was Crucified, Suffered Death, and Was Buried&rdquo; (collected in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780826461919"><em>God Still Matters</em></a>) by Herbert McCabe. This essay, I think, best presents the pithy line <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching">Terry Eagleton attributed</a> to McCabe: &ldquo;If you don’t love you’re dead, and if you do, they’ll kill you.&rdquo; (Come to think of it, that Eagleton essay could fit well into this slot, too.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781467459259"><em>The Love That Is God: An Invitation to Christian Faith</em>, by Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt</a>. It may be a bit premature to call this one a classic&mdash;though it is very, very good, &amp; destined to be a classic according to Sarah Coakley&rsquo;s foreword&mdash;&amp; the book isn&rsquo;t exactly an apologetic, but it fits well enough into this category. Fritz&mdash;who, full disclosure, directed my master&rsquo;s thesis while I was a graduate student at Loyola University Maryland&mdash;has left an impression on me that goes deeper than I think he realizes. <em>The Love That Is God</em> basically summarizes what I would want anyone to know about Christianity, &amp; so I feel it belongs in this spot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to&mdash;&amp; I think I will&mdash;revisit this list &amp; revise it in the future. (My <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/04/09/phil-christman-a.html">initial post on this idea</a> names a few others writers whom I&rsquo;d like to include, especially Dorothy Day.) I might swap out certain entries, I might add more categories to consider, or I might overhaul it entirely. But that, at least for the moment, is what I&rsquo;d suggest you read if you want to figure out what I get out of Christianity.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m not sure whether this is behind a paywall but Phil Christman&rsquo;s writing is well worth the $10 a month it costs.)</p>
<p>This is a cool idea; I might try to come up with my own list. Off the top of my head I&rsquo;d have to include Shūsaku Endō&rsquo;s <em>Silence</em>, probably <em>Les Misérables</em>, &amp; something by Thomas Merton (<em>Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</em> or <em>New Seeds of Contemplation</em>). Dorothy Day should be on here, too, &amp; at least an essay by Herbert McCabe. There&rsquo;d probably be a lot of overlap with <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2022/05/30/yesterday-i-saw.html">my personal canon</a>, but that&rsquo;s all right.</p>

			 <p>B. D. McClay, <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/you-cant-earn-easter">on the cost of cheap grace</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Catherine of Siena’s <em>Dialogue</em>, God says that “guilt is not atoned for by suffering simply as suffering,” adding that “the value is not in the suffering but in the soul’s desire.” His love isn’t merited through suffering, but simply present for us, whether or not we ask for it and whether or not we deserve it. Grace is equally cheap and equally costly to anybody willing to accept it. And Easter promises us that something has <em>actually happened</em>, that our faith doesn’t simply depend on a conveniently unrealized future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vatican.va/spirit/documents/spirit_20010414_omelia-sabato-santo_en.html">What is happening?</a> Today there is a great silence over the earth, a great silence, and stillness, a great silence because the King sleeps; the earth was in terror and was still, because God slept in the flesh and raised up those who were sleeping from the ages. God has died in the flesh, and the underworld has trembled.</p>
<p>Truly he goes to seek out our first parent like a lost sheep; he wishes to visit those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. He goes to free the prisoner Adam and his fellow-prisoner Eve from their pains, he who is God, and Adam&rsquo;s son.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But this is a grim and narrow view of the purpose of higher education, merely as a tool to train workers as replaceable cogs in America’s economic machine, to generate raw material for its largest companies. Higher education, with broad study in the liberal arts, is meant to create not merely good workers but good citizens. Citizens with knowledge of their history and culture are better equipped to lead and participate in a democratic society; learning in many different forms of knowledge teaches the humility necessary to accept other points of view in a pluralistic and increasingly globalized society.</p>

			 <p>Óscar Romero:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a sorry lot are those Christians who think that their religion is a museum of memories; their only desire is to preserve the memories and not expose themselves to danger. No, sisters and brothers, the church is communion and life; she is communion of life, and her members must confront life in real time. That is life. The church&rsquo;s laws, dogmas, and beliefs must be transformed into life. Those who don&rsquo;t want to understand the church this way are not worshiping the eternal living One, Christ, who will never die. We worship a living God who walks alongside the people, the God who tells us not to commit injustices because if the poor victims of usurers and loan sharks &ldquo;cry out to heaven, I will hear them, for I am the living God&rdquo; (Exod. 22:27).</p>

<p>One day the earth will belong to all people<br>
and the people will be free<br>
as you, God, have willed it<br>
from the very beginning.</p>
<p>This song speaks <em>to</em> God, not <em>about</em> God. It liberates us from the idol of fate in whose power everything happens simply as it happens. It binds us together with a God who is not the all-powerful conqueror but stands instead on the side of the poor and disadvantaged&mdash;a God who is always hidden in the world and wants to become visible.</p>

			 <p>I think Everything Everywhere All At Once will win <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2023">best picture</a> tonight (though I confess I haven&rsquo;t seen Elvis; Top Gun: Maverick; All Quiet on the Western Front; or Women Talking). It would be exciting &amp; encouraging to see such a zany movie win &amp; while I did enjoy it, I don&rsquo;t have nearly the enthusiasm for it that many people do. I thought the Daniels were a little too satisfied with themselves (&amp; it showed), &amp; I&rsquo;m not sure the movie deals with the existential dread of the multiverse as well as it thinks it does.</p>
<p>Of the best picture nominees I&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;d most like to see The Banshees of Inisherin win. It was weird; it was moving; it had a few amazing performances; &amp;, though dark, it didn&rsquo;t seem nearly as pessimistic as did EEAAO. 📽️</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Love! Love!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not war, not force! Even prayer, Brother Bernard, is not enough; good works are needed too. It is difficult and dangerous to live among men, but necessary. To withdraw into the wilderness and pray is too easy, too convenient. Prayer is slow in producing its miracles; works are faster, surer, more difficult. Wherever you find men, you will also find suffering, illness, and sin. That is where our place is, my brother: with lepers, sinners, with those who are starving. Deep down in the bowels of every man, even the saintliest ascetic, there sleeps a horrible, unclean larva. Lean over and say to this larva: ‘I love you!’ and it shall sprout wings and become a butterfly. &hellip; Love, I bow and worship thine omnipotence. Come and kiss our friars; come and accomplish thy miracle!&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So Rome is always dying (partially) from head down, while being (in part) resurrected from feet up. New forms of life have come from unexpected places&mdash;from Athanasius at local councils, Benedict in the monasteries, Albertus and Thomas in the universities, Francis of Assisi in the lanes and roads, Ignatius alone with a penitent making <em>The Spiritual Exercises</em>, Xavier and Ricci out at the rim of the world, Acton and Newman in pamphlets and journals.</p>
<p>These stirrings of life are not normally inspired, or even approved, by officials. Their leaders were held suspect, their teachings suppressed. Reformers could count themselves lucky if they were only silenced (like Abelard and Newman), condemned (like Erasmus and Wyclif), exiled by church authorities (like Athanasius and Chrysostom), or jailed by them (like St. John of the Cross and St. Ignatius of Loyola)&mdash;after all, St. Joan and Savonarola and John Hus were tortured and killed by them. But it has always been the task of the prophetic church, despite officials opposed to its opposition, to redeem the kingly church. Peter needs Paul&mdash;as Pope Innocent needed St. Francis, Pope Urban needed St. Catherine, or Pope Paul III needed Ignatius. As Paul VI needs Dan Berrigan. The Christian message is not authenticated from a throne.</p>

<p>What if we refused to make the suffering of Christ or Mary part of an algorithm and instead let their suffering stand? A community of memory and solidarity would refuse to rationalize the deaths of the unjustly murdered and instead commemorate their bodies, like <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781626980389?title=Sisters+in+the+Wilderness&amp;author=Dolores+S.+Williams&amp;cover_id=61623">Delores Williams</a>&rsquo;s desecration, as the victims of the blessed brutality of empire.

			 <p>B.D. McClay <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/phenomenology-gun">on the &ldquo;phenomenology of guns&rdquo;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t buy a tool to defend myself because I knew it would make me afraid—not that it would <em>admit</em> fear, but that it would transform the world around me into a world of potential threats. And while in fact I’ve had my share of low-level ugly encounters walking around my neighborhood—from nasty comments to someone blocking my way across the street with his car—I never wished that I had a can of wasp spray sitting in my pocket. If I had to say what I wished, it would be for the people who made it their business to intimidate me to see me as a person, too.</p>
<p>But if I had come to meet them armed, I would not have seen them as people either. They would have been unreal targets of potential violence—<em>mine</em>. And all I really know is that price is too high to pay.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve long wanted to write of mercy and justice in <em>Les Misérables</em>: what distinguishes Valjean and Javert, ultimately, is their different responses to an unmerited gift of mercy. <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/literature/victor-hugos-masterpiece-of-impossibility">Here&rsquo;s Caitrin Keiper for <em>Plough</em></a> on the seemingly impossibility of grace in <em>Les Mis</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main impossibility in the ideal of <em>Les Misérables</em> is not that suffering will disappear, but that it can be redeemed; that brokenness does not erase the hope in any person; that dormant souls come back to life; that the cycle of retribution breaks for grace. And for symbolic confirmation of this impossible reality, there is an intimation of the stars on earth – that is, candles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To overcome careerism and knowingness [the urge to present yourself as always already informed] and instill in students a desire to learn, schools and parents need to convince students (and perhaps themselves) that college has more to offer than job training. You’re a worker for only part of your life; you’re a human being, a creature with a powerful brain, throughout it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, after all who ensnare their blind lovers<br>
in a deceitful and turbulent world<br>
have been completely passed over,<br>
may you totally love Him<br>
Who gave Himself totally for your love,<br>
At Whose beauty the sun and the moon marvel,<br>
Whose rewards and their uniqueness and grandeur have no limits;<br>
I am speaking of Him,<br>
the Son of the Most High,<br>
Whom the Virgin brought to birth<br>
and remained a virgin after His birth.</p>
<p>May you cling to His most sweet mother who gave birth to a Son Whom the heavens could not contain, and yet she carried Him in the little cloister of her holy womb and held Him on her virginal lap.</p>

<p>We are called to be a Church that worships a Jesus who is poor and that serves him in the poor. As a saintly bishop once said: “The Church supports and blesses efforts to change the structures of injustice, and sets down but one condition: that social, economic and political change truly benefit the poor” (St. Óscar Romero). Certainly, it is not easy to leave the comfortable warmth of worldliness to embrace the stark beauty of the grotto of Bethlehem, but let us remember that <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/pope-francis-it-not-truly-christmas-without-poor">it is not truly Christmas without the poor</a>. Without the poor, we can celebrate Christmas, but not the birth of Jesus. Dear brothers, dear sisters, at Christmas God is poor: let charity be reborn!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it makes sense that in a film so focused on the necessity of a whole social web, of interpersonal love and loyalty, greatness would ultimately be something we ultimately derive from each other—a kind of common property. My friend Olivia quoted the line “your money is in Joe’s house and Jack’s house and the house next door to you.” Harry’s greatness (his war heroism) is in George, who saves his life; <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/there-is-no-mary-problem-in-its-a-wonderful-life/">George’s is in Mary</a>. Where did Mary’s come from? It’s outside the scope of the film, but it didn’t start with her, either.</p>

			 <p>Howard Thurman on forgiveness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does seem that Jesus dealt with every act of forgiveness as one who was convinced that there is in every act of injury an element that is irresponsible and irrational. No evil deed&mdash;and no good deed, either&mdash;was named by him as an expression of the total mind of the doer. Once, when someone addressed him as &ldquo;Good Master,&rdquo; Jesus is quoted as having said, &ldquo;Why callest thou me good? there is none good, but&hellip;God.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Thomas Merton on the goodness of humans &amp; original sin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hate others because we cannot stand the disorder, the intolerable division in ourselves. We are violent to others because we are already divided by the inner violence of our infidelity to our own truth. Hatred projects this division outside ourselves into society. This is not far from the traditional doctrine of the Fathers of the Church concerning original sin! Note of course that the doctrine of original sin, properly understood, is <em>optimistic</em>. It does not teach that man is by nature evil, but that evil in him is unnatural, a disorder, a sin. If evil, lying, and hatred were natural to man, all men would be perfectly at home, perfectly happy in evil. Perhaps a few seem to find contentment in an unnatural state of falsity, hatred, and greed. They are not happy. Or if they are, they are unnatural.</p>

<p>A paradox is just the correct formulation of an issue you don’t understand, and the answer to it is one you could not expect. I think that in any science, paradoxes are crucial. When there is no paradox, there is no possible improvement in knowledge. So the question is how you get into the paradox and how you get out of it.

			 <p>Thomas Merton on Christmas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Into this world, this demented inn, in which there is absolutely no room for him at all, Christ comes uninvited. But because he cannot be at home in it, because he is out of place in it, and yet he must be in it, his place is with those others for whom there is no room. His place is with those who do not belong, who are rejected by power because they are regarded as weak, those who are discredited, who are denied the status of persons, tortured, exterminated. With those for whom there is no room, Christ is present in this world. He is mysteriously present in those for whom there seems to be nothing but the world at its worst.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She [Lilith] stood rigid. Mara buried her head in her hands. I gazed on the face of one who knew existence but not love⁠—knew nor life, nor joy, nor good; with my eyes I saw the face of a live death! She knew life only to know that it was dead, and that, in her, death lived. It was not merely that life had ceased in her, but that she was consciously a dead thing. She had killed her life, and was dead⁠—and knew it. She must <em>death it</em> forever and ever! She had tried her hardest to unmake herself, and could not! she was a dead life! she could not cease! she must <em>be</em>! In her face I saw and read beyond its misery⁠—saw in its dismay that the dismay behind it was more than it could manifest. It sent out a livid gloom; the light that was in her was darkness, and after its kind it shone. She was what God could not have created. She had usurped beyond her share in self-creation, and her part had undone His! She saw now what she had made, and behold, it was not good! She was as a conscious corpse, whose coffin would never come to pieces, never set her free! Her bodily eyes stood wide open, as if gazing into the heart of horror essential⁠—her own indestructible evil. Her right hand also was now clenched⁠—upon existent Nothing⁠—her inheritance!</p>
<p>But with God all things are possible: He can save even the rich!</p>

			 <p>The last of <a href="https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/seven-theses-on-catholic-theology/">Anne Carpenter&rsquo;s seven theses on Catholic theology</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no either/or: God or history, the Incarnation or people of color, the Trinity or the oppressed, all that is divine and all that is just. Catholics need not stop short. We need not refuse the divine meaning surging through history in the forgotten of history. We need not say that it is enough, somehow, to have a diverse humanities, to study diverse sciences, and not to ask what this “diversity” means to God. Our refusal to draw back from the height residing in the depths would be a radical transfiguration of Catholic theology, and also its coming back to itself.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seriously considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/opinion/college-oral-exam.html?smid=url-share">making the final assessment in my classes an oral exam</a>, but I&rsquo;ve always decided against it for a number of reasons. My primary concern was the time commitment&mdash;with 100 undergraduate students across 4 sections, I thought it would just be too time-consuming. But I think this article is probably right that if I can more or less grade the exam on the spot it wouldn&rsquo;t take any longer than grading a written exam.</p>

			 <p>I love Indiana Jones&mdash;<em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> is my absolute favorite movie&mdash;but I&rsquo;m afraid <a href="https://youtu.be/y170QEOgYZ4">this trailer for the new Indiana Jones movie</a> doesn&rsquo;t do much for me. Indy&rsquo;s voiceover elicits nothing from me other than a slight cringe, and (judging from the shots in the trailer, anyway) it looks much too slick. What makes Indiana Jones Indiana Jones is the grit and texture. Without that, it&rsquo;s just another action-adventure movie. I&rsquo;ll see it and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be entertained, but I don&rsquo;t have high hopes. 📽️</p>

			 <p>My biggest theological pet peeve is when people attribute &lsquo;penal substitutionary atonement&rsquo; to Anselm of Canterbury. On the contrary, he presents his theory of &lsquo;satisfaction&rsquo; as <em>an alternative to</em> penal accounts of atonement!</p>

However, if the source of your trouble is the issue of that and which we may be of some small assistance.</p>

			 <p>I know less about Albert Schweitzer than I probably should, but what a way to end a book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He comes to us as One unknown, without a name, as of old, by the lake-side, He came to those men who knew him not. He speaks to us the same word: &lsquo;Follow thou me&rsquo; and sets us to the task which He has to fulfill for our time. He commands. And to those who obey Him, whether they be wise or simple, He will reveal Himself in the toils, the conflicts, the sufferings which they shall pass through in His fellowship, and as an ineffable mystery, they shall learn in their own experience Who He is.</p>

			 <p>Cyril of Alexandria, in <em>Quod sit unum</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that they [those who subscribe to a Nestorian christology] have turned the mystery of the economy in the flesh completely on its head, for in their argument one cannot see how God the Word, born of God, and God by nature, abased himself to a self-emptying and humbled himself to assume the form of a slave. On the contrary, in their estimate a man is exalted into the glory of the Godhead and into preeminence over all things; he receives the form of God and is raised on high and comes to be enthroned alongside the Father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all the times I&rsquo;ve read this text, I&rsquo;d never really tracked this particular movement in the argument. Nestorian christology tries to protect God from the humiliation of finite flesh in the incarnation, instead emphasizing the exaltation of an assumed man. But for Cyril, the humility is the whole point; it is only by that humility according to which the Word empties himself that humans have any hope of the exaltation that Nestorius seeks.</p>

<p>Donning St. Francis’s rags or St. Michael Archangel’s wings or Mary’s star-speckled mantle—this too reminds the devils of their defeat. Our pastors want us to costume our children as the saints precisely because death could not hold them. Why, then, not also dress them as the enemy, who rather ridiculously presumed death’s caress deeper and longer than love’s? Why not mock the mocker?</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe on the Trinity (from &ldquo;A Sermon for Pentecost&rdquo; in <em>God Still Matters</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God understands, contemplates, his divine life. We can think of God as forming a concept of himself (we don&rsquo;t have to, but we can); we can think of God&rsquo;s understanding as God&rsquo;s conceiving what it is to be God – having an idea of the meaning of being God; God naming himself &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; We can think, as John may have done, of the concept or Word of God that was in the beginning with God, and was God; &lsquo;was God&rsquo; because it was the perfect, utterly adequate thought of God, no different from God. So the revelation of the Word made flesh is God&rsquo;s own idea of himself dwelling amongst us, God&rsquo;s word to himself becoming his word to us.</p>
<p>And then we can think (we don&rsquo;t have to but we can) of the joy that God takes in contemplating his life, his divinity, in the Word – that profound acquiescence in being divine: the immense joy of the eternal God, not now in what he has created or done, but in what he is just in living, in being God. God knows his life and, in knowing it, loves it. Or: in eternity, the Father, contemplating his divine life, brings forth the Word, and through the Word gives forth Joy, the Spirit. So, as a reflection of this eternal life, in history, the father sends to us the Word made flesh, Jesus, and through the Word made flesh, gives forth to us the Joy of the Spirit, to make the Church. What happens in the story of Jesus is the image, the sign, the sacrament of the divine life in eternity. This is the tremendous mystery that the first disciples experienced (seemed almost to experience in their bodies) at Pentecost, the expression of the immense joy of God.</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe on original sin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To believe that Jesus is of God is to believe that, in rejecting him, people are making the most ultimate kind of rejection, the final contradiction of themselves. The crucifixion is not just one more case of a particular society showing its inhumanity. It is the whole human race showing its rejection of itself. The resurrection is the Father&rsquo;s refusal to accept this self-rejection of man.</p>

			 <p>Michael D.C. Drout, <a href="https://nyti.ms/3CS5jvH">Please Don&rsquo;t Make a Tolkien Cinematic Universe</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tolkien is utterly consistent with this morality, even at the expense of his most cherished characters: Frodo has no other choice than to use the power of the Ring to dominate Gollum, but he still pays for that immoral act when he is unable to complete his quest or to enjoy his life afterward. Can a company as intent upon domination as Amazon really understand this perspective — and adapt that morality to the screen?</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe, on God&rsquo;s name:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;God&rsquo;, &lsquo;Theos&rsquo;, &lsquo;Deus&rsquo; is of course a name borrowed from paganism; we take it out of its proper context, where it is used for talking about the gods, and use it for our own purposes. This is quite a legitimate piece of borrowing and quite safe so long as it does not mislead us into thinking that the God we worship (or don&rsquo;t) is a god. We always do have to speak of our God with borrowed words; it is one of the special things about our God that there are no peculiarly appropriate words that belong to him, as with the language of carpentry or computer-speak. He is always dressed verbally in second-hand clothes that don&rsquo;t fit him very well. We always have to be on our guard against taking these clothes as revealing who and what he is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I generally like this paragraph, though I wonder if there at least three words that are not borrowed and so can be used properly of God, precisely because God has revealed Godself as: Father, Son, Holy Spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as a natural death: nothing that happens to a man is ever natural, since his presence calls the world into question. All men must die: but for every man his death is an accident and, even if he knows it and consents to it, an unjustifiable violation.</p>

			 <p>I love this paragraph, from <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307764485">The Married Man</a> by Edmund White (Ajax is Austin and Julien&rsquo;s basset hound puppy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Austin had never heard any whimsy coming out of Julien&rsquo;s mouth before, but now it never stopped. Julien decided that he would raise Ajax to be the next pope. He was constantly on the lookout for pious deeds and minor miracles, which would confirm his calling. Julien started calling him Pius VII, which in French was pronounced &ldquo;<em>Pissette</em>&rdquo; and also meant &ldquo;little pisser.&rdquo; The whole idea was mad and in the worst taste, but Julien clung to it so long that Austin suspected he took it half-seriously.</p>

This is a bit of a spoiler, thematically at least, but: I think of <em>Breaking Bad</em> and <em>Better Call Saul</em> as thematic opposites. <em>Breaking Bad</em> is about the corroding and self-annihilating effects of sin and evil, whereas <em>Better Call Saul</em> is about the redemptive possibility of love and grace.</p>

			 <p>A nice piece by Phil Christman on <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/developing-your-voice?utm_medium=reader2">finding one&rsquo;s voice</a>. His chief counsel is patience. It takes time to develop a voice, and one&rsquo;s voice emerges from imitation and modification of other&rsquo;s voices. Finding your voice also involves figuring out what&rsquo;s so central to who you are that you can&rsquo;t bear it being said anything less than perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever your deal is, whatever you think is true, whatever is so beautifully right to you that it gets you out of bed in the morning (and if it’s just the scream of your baby that gets you out of bed, that’s still a worldview, because somewhere behind all your exhaustion you believe that that baby is worth raising, you believe it unquestioningly, and if you didn’t you’d quit and fail like lots of parents do)—it’s all been said before, but it’s been said <em>a little bit wrong</em>, because it’s been said by humans. So you dig into your experience and find the examples, the details, the concessions, the stories that will proclaim the thing the way <em>you</em> want it proclaimed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you can do this, you&rsquo;ve got a voice. 💬</p>

I&rsquo;m not entirely satisfied with these pictures; the color is a little underwhelming to me, which may be a consequence of either the film itself or the UV filter I&rsquo;ve used. The color of the sky is especially drab; it should be more blue than gray!</p>

(The other hours of the workday are spent collating notes, tracking down citations, planning the research, etc.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The story I&rsquo;d heard told about St. Joseph&rsquo;s Oratory is this: when construction on the dining hall was completed, the University used the leftover bricks to build this oratory for the sisters working in the dining hall so they would have a place for quiet and prayer between meals. (I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true now, given that <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/studentpages/buildings/Devereux.htm">this webpage</a> reports the oratory as a gift from an Olean resident.) When I was a student here it was mostly empty, though in the years after I graduated one of the friars turned it into a chapel for perpetual eucharistic adoration. I don&rsquo;t think it serves that role any longer.</p>

<p>The courtyard of <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/studentpages/buildings/Devereux.htm">Devereux Hall</a>, the oldest building (I think) on campus. Thomas Merton lived here (though on the other side of the building) when he taught at St. Bonaventure just before joining the Trappists. I love how the building almost entirely consumed with ivy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A detail of the ivy that hangs from Devereux Hall. This is, I think, my favorite of the set; the colors here (especially the green of the ivy) are more vibrant, and the light dances off the ivy.</p>

<p>The main quad.</p>

<p>And finally, the bell tower and <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/chapel/index.htm">university chapel</a>. The bells are missing (I think they were taken down for some repair).</p>

Now that the show&rsquo;s finishing its run and it&rsquo;s gotten consistently good reviews (<a href="https://davidbentleyhart.substack.com/p/thoughts-in-and-out-of-season-2">including from none other than David Bentley Hart</a>), Jacqueline and I are watching it through.</p>

			 <p>One of the peculiarities of writing a dissertation during 2020–21 was the lack of library access.

Still, I&rsquo;m glad to have more regular access to a library again (and one as good as the Franciscan Institute&rsquo;s in Friedsam Memorial Library!).</p>

			 <p>I like this characterization of prayer, in the fourth book of the Franciscan <em>Summa halensis</em> (q.26, m.3, a.7; p. 720 in the 1622 Cologne edition). A quick and rough translation (verging on paraphrase, really):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Properly speaking, prayer is the ascent of the soul to God ordered to the tasting or releasing of something; commonly speaking, prayer is any act of contemplation related to God; most commonly speaking, prayer is any good act.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three was enough to provide just enough content, but to allow for the imagination of the viewer space to begin its own play. Now, there’s just too much of everything. Once Star Wars represented limitless possibility of imagination; now it’s just another boring action series, of which there are already one million. Here, as with all cultural products, we’re approaching a general glut of the human spirit, caused by the overproduction of boring crap.</p>

			 <p>Willie James Jennings, with a really lovely description of theological education at the end of his <em>After Whiteness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be involved in theological education is to long for eternity and the end of death. It is to seek the blessed state where our words start to do new work by first joining the chorus of the words of those who live forever in the Lord and who sound the healing and redeeming voice of the living God. Then our words will heal. Then our words will build up. Then our words will help form life together. Then our words will give witness to a destiny only visible through love. Talking together then is a practice aimed at eternity, and it matters more than we often realize for bringing our hope into focus. This finally is the goal of this book and the task I want to leave you with&mdash;to bring hope into focus.</p>

			 <p>Willie James Jennings, <em>After Whiteness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theological education could mark a new path for Western education, one that builds a vision of education that cultivates the new belonging that this world longs to inhabit. But we cannot give witness to that newness if we imagine that our fundamental struggle is one of institutional survival, or the challenge of educational delivery systems, or the alignment of financial modeling with our desired outcomes, or the expansion of pedagogical models. All these matters are important, but they are not where the struggle meets us or from where the vision of our futures will come.</p>

			 <p>Willie James Jennings, <em>After Whiteness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theological education is also about resistance. It is the seed from which may grow beautiful habitation or from which may grow mind-bending captivity. Yet how do you design for intellectual resistance? This may be the most pressing question in theological education today, because we theological educators are failing miserably at precisely this&mdash;at imagining a form of resistance that builds community.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I saw a tweet floating around asking for your &ldquo;personal canon,&rdquo; that is, which are the books that you have used to understand the world? Limiting myself only to written works (and not, say, music or film), here&rsquo;s what I would say, roughly ordered according to when I encountered these books:</p>
<ul>
<li>The gospel according to Luke</li>
<li>The book of Revelation</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780553116090">A Wizard of Earthsea</a></em> by Ursula K. Le Guin</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780785825173">A Christmas Carol</a></em> by Charles Dickens</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812974263">Les Misérables</a></em> by Victor Hugo</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307589521">Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</a></em> by Thomas Merton</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780872205659">Proslogion</a></em> by Anselm of Canterbury</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307827807">The Plague</a></em> by Albert Camus</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780060936990">The Prophets</a></em> by Abraham J. Heschel</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250082244">Silence</a></em> by Shūsaku Endō</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9783559253561">Notes of a Native Son</a></em> by James Baldwin</li>
<li><em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781608331246">On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent</a></em> by Gustavo Gutiérrez</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much reading from my childhood represented; I&rsquo;m not sure that much reading from before college has stuck with me in this world-shaping way. My list also skews decidedly modern (only three premodern texts), which is a little embarassing for me as a medieval theologian.</p>
<p>I might develop this into a fuller blog post, detailing why each of these books belong to my canon and how they inform my understanding of the world. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll think of other books to add, too (and maybe, upon further refletion, remove some of these).</p>

			 <p>I watched &ldquo;part 1&rdquo; of <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> earlier today. While I&rsquo;m enjoying this story more than, say, <em>The Mandalorian</em>, my experience viewing it is basically the same as the other Disney+ <em>Star Wars</em> series: I simply do not find them all that engaging. (The sequel films, especially <em>The Last Jedi</em>, are better in this respect, but they have their own problems; I find <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> unwatchable, far worse than the prequel trilogy.) The major problem for me, I think, is the enormous aesthetic gulf that exists between George Lucas&rsquo;s <em>Star Wars</em> and Disney&rsquo;s <em>Star Wars</em>. Lucas&rsquo;s excesses are probably to blame for the shortcomings of the prequel trilogy (though I don&rsquo;t find those films as horrendous as others do), but the most recent <em>Star Wars</em> entries feel to me more like Marvel movies than <em>Star Wars</em> films.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/topics/faith/devotional-reading/the-way-chapter-romero">one of Óscar Romero&rsquo;s homilies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want peace, but not the peace of violence and of cemeteries, not peace imposed or extorted. We want peace that is the fruit of justice, peace that is the fruit of obedience to God, for God was expecting the righteousness and justice that his vineyard should have produced but got in return only murders. What we have of humanity and Christianity in El Salvador should have produced much peace, much right, much justice. How different our country would be if it were producing what God has planted here! It’s sad to say, but God feels he has failed with certain societies, and I think that the passages from Isaiah and Saint Paul that we read today have become a very sad Salvadoran reality: “I looked for righteousness, and behold, murders! I looked for justice, and behold, laments!” (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Is5.7">Isa. 5:7</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Violence begets injury begets death, and any culture debased to vacillating between violent struggle and idle nihilism is shuddering toward its end as a culture of death. And a culture of death is like a prophecy, or a sickness: It bespeaks itself in worsening phases. Right now, we find ourselves foreclosing upon our own shared future both recklessly and deliberately—and perhaps, gradually, beginning to behave as if there is no future for us at all; soon, I sometimes worry, we may find ourselves faced with a darkening present, no faith in our future, and a doomed tendency to chase violence with violence.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://forward.com/culture/503637/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-uvalde/">Robert Zaretsky, on what a deeper appreciation of the word ‘tragedy’ reveals about tragedies like school shootings</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet if we could wring out the word’s semantic saturation, we might glimpse an earlier and more useful use of the word. A usage, in effect, that reminds us that tragedy remains Greek to us. In his recent book, <em>Tragedy, the Greeks and Us</em>, the philosopher Simon Critchley explores how the ancient Greek tragedians understood their world. Tragedy is not simply something that happens to us, the way that, say, a meteor happened to dinosaurs 65 million years ago or, for that matter, an earthquake happened to the residents of Lisbon 250 years ago. Both events were out of the control of its victims.</p>
<p>Not so with real tragedies, though. The works of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides reveal the human factor in the making of tragedy. As Critchley writes, “Tragedy requires some degree of complicity on our part in the disaster that destroys us.” It is not that the gods did this to us, but that we collaborated with the gods to do this to us. The upshot, as Critchley makes clear, is terrifying: “Tragedy requires our collusion with [our] fate. In other words, it requires no small measure of freedom.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That horror cannot be blamed just on one unhinged person. It was the sacrifice we as a culture made, and continually make, to our demonic god. We guarantee that crazed man after crazed man will have a flood of killing power readily supplied him. We have to make that offering, out of devotion to our Moloch, our god. The gun is our Moloch. We sacrifice children to him daily—sometimes, as at Sandy Hook, by directly throwing them into the fire-hose of bullets from our protected private killing machines, sometimes by blighting our children’s lives by the death of a parent, a schoolmate, a teacher, a protector.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a problem gets harder to solve, ignoring it becomes all the more tempting. Ignore it long enough, and eventually it becomes unsolvable. Giving up can then seem to deliver a measure of relief, in that it appears, at least for a moment, to liberate us from the agonies of our failing efforts. But such relief cannot last, as the unsolved problem will continue to create problems and cause suffering. This suffering rarely feels like freedom.</p>

			 <p>Maggie Nelson, discussing an interview given by Pema Chödtön:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m riveted by this formulation, &ldquo;the environment was safe, but the teachings were threatening,&rdquo; as it names a paradox at the heart of much intellectual and artistic creation and pedagogy, one especially relevant for those of us who have devoted much of our lives to the contemplation and creation of transgressive work, as well as to supporting and respecting students. You can work to make a safe environment, but if the teachings at hand are meant to rattle, people are going to feel rattled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to reflect on this more in my own teaching. It seems to me that this describes (or should describe) what it is to teach Christian theology, particularly in the context of higher education. It seems to me the commitments and practices of Christianity destabilize the commitments and practices most students enter my classroom with;   they probably destabilize the commitments and practices they are taught by many other professors, too.</p>

<p>I loved the Church for Christ made visible. Not for itself, because it was so often a scandal to me. Romano Guardini said the Church is the Cross on which Christ was crucified; one could not separate Christ from His Cross, and one must live in a state of permanent dissatisfaction with the Church.</p>

			 <p>David Bentley Hart, in <em>Tradition and Apocalypse</em>, on the theological virtues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faith is the will to let the past be reborn in the present as more than what until now had been known, and the will to let the present be shaped by a future yet to be revealed. Hope is the conviction that that revelation will not only fulfill but far exceed the promise that the tradition preserves within itself. And, in the end, faith and hope will both pass away, or rather pass over into perfect love&mdash;which is, at the last, another name, and perhaps the highest, for that final horizon that calls all thought and all of creation to itself.</p>

			 <p>One of the things I miss most about Boston is living in the interreligious community that was the Barton House. On Good Friday 2020, we gathered to commemorate the way of the cross with <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2021/03/29/el-vacrucis.html">a service my friend Laurel and I wrote together</a>.

			 <p>David Bentley Hart on tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tradition&rsquo;s life, it turns out, is an irrepressible apocalyptic ferment within, beckoning believers simultaneously back to an immemorial past and forward to an unimaginable future. The proper moral and spiritual attitude to tradition&rsquo;s formal expressions, if all of this is correct, would be not a simple clinging to what has been received, but also a relinquishing, even at times of things that had once seemed most precious: <em>Gelassenheit</em>, to use Eckhart&rsquo;s language, release. Only thus can one receive tradition as a liberating counterhistory, as the apocalyptic exception to bare history that promises believers a higher truth than death: by remembering a first interruption, awaiting a last interruption, and attempting to sustain the theme uniting them in the interval. Only thus can the faithful find the meaninglessness of bare history converted into a completed tale of vocation and judgment, of a call heard from far away that nevertheless summons them to a promised homeland.</p>

			 <p>A recent eBay acquisition: a Pentax K1000 35mm film camera. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get into film photography for a while now, and I was recently struck by an urge to find a good beginner&rsquo;s camera to get started. The K1000 seemed the clear choice for a number of reason: its availability, its price, its simplicity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What I like about this camera is its fully mechanical operation: though it does have a battery, that battery only powers the built-in light meter. Otherwise, the camera operates completely mechanically—and you can really feel it when you release the shutter.</p>
<p>The camera has basically no features at all, apart from the light meter: manual focus, manual exposure. Its lack of features was another selling point to me. I want little more than the absolute basics as I get into film photography. There&rsquo;s something about the bare bones simplicity of the K1000 that seems to lend the photos it shoots with honesty and integrity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a few shots just around town, mainly getting a feel for the camera and testing out different exposures. I&rsquo;m hoping to get through a roll in a week or so, so I can send the film off to be developed and see how accurate the light meter is.</p>

<p>No. 123. Whenever I speak of faith, I am not speaking of faith in God. Likewise, when I speak of doubt, I am not talking about doubting God&rsquo;s existence, or the truth of any gospel. Such terms have never meant very much to me. To contemplate them reminds me of playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey: you get spun around until you wander off, disoriented and blindfolded, walking gingerly with a hand stretched out in front of you, until you either run into a wall (laughter), or a friend gently pushes you back toward the game.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>No. 125. Of course, you could also just take off the blindfold and say, <em>I think this game is stupid, and I&rsquo;m not playing it anymore</em>. And it must also be admitted that hitting the wall or wandering off in the wrong direction or tearing off the blindfold is as much a part of the game as is pinning the tail on the donkey.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hearing each other&rsquo;s voices, individual thoughts, and sometimes associating theses voices [sic] with personal experience makes us more acutely aware of each other. That moment of collective participation and dialogue means that students and professor respect&mdash;and here I invoke the root meaning of the word, &ldquo;to look&rdquo;&mdash;at each other, engage in acts of recognition with one another, and do not just talk to the professor. Sharing experiences and confessional narratives in the classroom helps establish communal commitment to learning. These narrative moments usually are the space where the assumption that we share a common class background and perspective is disrupted. While students may be open to the idea that they do not all come from a common class background, they may still expect that the values of materially privileged groups will be the class&rsquo;s norm.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s important to remind students that joy can be present <em>along with hard work</em>. Not every moment in the classroom will necessarily be one that brings you immediate pleasure, but that doesn&rsquo;t preclude the possibility of joy. Nor does it deny the reality that learning can be painful. And sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary to remind students and colleagues that pain and painful situations don&rsquo;t necessarily translate into harm. We make that very fundamental mistake all the time. Not all pain is harm, and not all pleasure is good.</p>

Like Bauerschmidt, I used Herbert McCabe&rsquo;s image of evil as hole-in-sock to try to balance both <em>privatio boni</em> and our real experience of evil as surd. But I wish I&rsquo;d had this homily to share with my students. (I plan to share it in class this week.)</p>

			 <p>Daniel Walden, <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/one-more-lifeless-idol">in a review of a very bad recent book</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of us [on the political left] came to our politics precisely because we do sense that we have unchosen obligations to the people around us, and some people may have childhood memories of strong neighborhood or community bonds that made it easy for them to wander around safely, or of large family gatherings that included people who were not blood relatives but might as well have been. People <em>should</em> be able to let their children wander freely around safe neighborhoods; they should be able to form strong relationships with their neighbors and fellow local citizens, go to silly productions at the community theater, and shop for the things they need at stores owned and run by people who live alongside them. And if the community where they live doesn’t provide what they need to be happy, they should be able to find one that does. I am sure that such communities, were people able to live in them, would develop local traditions and institutions that would help cement people’s connection to one another, and I view it as the role of the state to underwrite the basic necessities of life for every person precisely so that we will be free to form the sorts of communities that will nourish us and let us form the loving relationships that sustain human life.</p>

			 <p>Paul Griffiths, on the LORD as theology&rsquo;s topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Christians prepare to approach the LORD in eucharistic worship, they do so haltingly, repeatedly underlining in the words they speak that what they are about to do cannot be done. Even after the bread and wine have been consecrated before the congregation’s face and offered to it, and even after the declaration is made that those who can receive the body and blood are happy—blessed—to be able to do so, the congregation declares that it is incapable of receiving what is offered, echoing, in doing so, the scriptural words of the Roman centurion who asks Jesus to heal his servant: <em>non sum dignus ut intres sub tectum meum, sed tantum dic verbo et sanabitur anima mea</em> (I’m not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed). All theological discourse works under this rubric: <em>non sum dignus &hellip; tantum dic verbo</em>. Theologians, whether believers or not, lovers of the LORD or not, need to remember this so that theology, rather than something else, is what they do.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-dawn-of-everything-a-new-history-of-humanity/9780374157357">David Graeber &amp; David Wengrow&rsquo;s <em>The Dawn of Everything</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>American citizens have the right to travel wherever they like – provided, of course, they have the money for transport and accommodation. They are free from ever having to obey the arbitrary orders of superiors – unless, of course, they have to get a job. In this sense, it is almost possible to say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people">the Wendat</a> had play chiefs and real freedoms, while most of us today have to make do with real chiefs and play freedoms. Or to put the matter more technically: what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people">the Hadza</a>, Wendat or ‘egalitarian’ people such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuer_people">the Nuer</a> seem to have been concerned with were not so much formal freedoms as substantive ones. They were less interested in the right to travel than in the possibility of actually doing so (hence, the matter was typically framed as an obligation to provide hospitality to strangers). Mutual aid – what contemporary European observers often referred to as ‘communism’ – was seen as the necessary condition for individual autonomy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Graeber &amp; Wengrow invent this distinction&mdash;I assume not&mdash;but distinguishing &lsquo;formal&rsquo; freedoms from &lsquo;substantive&rsquo; freedoms is helpful. My sense is that the political left in the United States has largely ceded talk of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to the right; you don&rsquo;t often (or, at least, I don&rsquo;t often) encounter arguments for leftist politics on the basis of freedom. But in fact, I think, the left does want &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; for people and their proposals can help facilitate such freedom. The difference is the left is less concerned with formal freedom (the concern of the right) than it is with substantive freedom.</p>
<p>This is one piece of Graeber &amp; Wengrow&rsquo;s work that I really appreciate. They repeatedly stress that American indigenous peoples had a worldview closer to the contemporary US than European Enlightenment thinkers, because American indigenous peoples were concerned with (substantive) freedom. It&rsquo;s a clever rhetorical move: both the original inhabitants of the American continents and the present inhabitants of the American continents are interested in freedom; the difference is, in what that freedom consists.</p>

			 <p>David Bentley Hart, on one&rsquo;s just deserts before God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remain convinced that no one, logically speaking, could merit eternal punishment; but I also accept
the obverse claim that no one could merit grace. This does not mean, however, that grace must be rare in order to be truly gracious, as so many in the infernalist party so casually assume it must. Grace universally given is still grace. A gift made to everyone is no less a gift, and a gift that is intrinsically precious need not be rare to be an act of the highest generosity. Conversely, that gift becomes no more precious—indeed, it becomes much less so—if it is certified in its value by being distributed only parsimoniously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor does this mean calling for forgiveness when it involves renouncing our own rights, confronting corrupt officials, criminals or those who would debase our dignity. We are called to love everyone, without exception; at the same time, loving an oppressor does not mean allowing him to keep oppressing us, or letting him think that what he does is acceptable. On the contrary, true love for an oppressor means seeking ways to make him cease his oppression; it means stripping him of a power that he does not know how to use, and that diminishes his own humanity and that of others. Forgiveness does not entail allowing oppressors to keep trampling on their own dignity and that of others, or letting criminals continue their wrongdoing. Those who suffer injustice have to defend strenuously their own rights and those of their family, precisely because they must preserve the dignity they have received as a loving gift from God. If a criminal has harmed me or a loved one, no one can forbid me from demanding justice and ensuring that this person – or anyone else – will not harm me, or others, again. This is entirely just; forgiveness does not forbid it but actually demands it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freud said that mourning is a &ldquo;great riddle,&rdquo; and its greatness partially consists in its not being the kind of riddle that gets solved. Mourning, he says, is &ldquo;one of those phenomena which cannot themselves be explained but to which other obscurities can be traced back.&rdquo; In essence, mourning is one of the ways we exercise our capacity for love. We get attached to people and ideals, thoughts and projects that are themselves vulnerable. And we respond to that vulnerability by becoming active ourselves in making sense of what it all meant or will continue to mean. Other animals suffer loss; other animals grieve in complex ways. If we want, we can call that mourning. But our form of mourning is an attempt to turn loss into a reanimated gain&mdash;in imagination, thought, emotion and, importantly, symbolic expression. We make human meanings, and when we can share these meanings publicly it is constitutive of the formation of culture. Aristotle lived; Aristotle died: it is only our activity that transforms this change into loss and into a certain kind of gain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reading Beauvoir’s work alongside Weil’s can make it clear that freedom exists not only in what we do but in what we do not do. Rising to the challenge of our freedom does not mean living a life of hedonism or selfishness. It might mean living more like Weil—taking what you need, and giving away the surplus—with the caveat that one takes what one actually needs. With the acceptance of our moral freedom comes a widening of our moral imagination—that we do not have to relegate heroism to others or tell ourselves comforting stories to get through our lives.</p>

<p>No, what mystifies me is the insistence on acting like <em>having to see or talk to</em> the homeless is <em>in itself</em> a social problem, not <em>because they’re homeless</em> but because <em>you had to see it</em>. I think I’m a pretty sinful person, but that feeling I simply don’t relate to. If the person is screaming at you or following you or physically attacking you, you’re within your rights to get mad, obviously, as you would at anyone who does those things, but if the person is simply standing there and asking you for a tenner, you say “I’m sorry, man, I don’t have it, but good luck” and you keep walking. To feel anger at that person (rather than at, say, the mayor, or the governor, or the President, or God, or yourself) just makes no sense to me, except as the expression of a deep, atavistic human instinct that tells us that misery is a contagious disease.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of our frustrations with our children lie in the fact that they have not yet learned to find certain forms of—trivial, mundane—suffering to be intelligible. Young children do not seem to understand any suffering. Yet even after we exit childhood, we are guaranteed to encounter misfortunes that surpass our understanding. If Weil is right, the form that these experiences take is interrogative: the expression of affliction, because it is a request for understanding, comes in the form of a question.</p>

			 <p>Something that&rsquo;s long irritiated me is when people excuse their own rudeness or cruelty by claiming to be &ldquo;blunt&rdquo; or &ldquo;brutally honest.&rdquo; That may be, but more often than not, I find that such people actually just can&rsquo;t be bothered to put in the effort to be polite to other people by filtering out whatever happens to pop into their head. <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/cruelty-isnt-clarity">Phil Christman&rsquo;s comments</a> on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/style/marriage-heather-havrilesky-foreverland.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">that recent terrible NYT piece about hating one&rsquo;s spouse</a> offer further insight on a similar phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I run into this assumption all the time, that the meanest take or harshest thought you might have about someone else, the most reductive, one-datum-reflected-in-a-funhouse-mirror-so-it’s-all-you-see sort of vision, is held up as some truth that we’re normally too weak to face. A person who is casually cruel always defends themselves by saying “Well at least I’m honest.” Honesty about <em>what is running through your head right this second</em> isn’t the same as <em>honesty in the sense of actually making the effort to get other people and things right</em>. The second thing takes forever, which is one reason why a marriage does.</p>

<p>Frodo, of Gollum: It&rsquo;s a pity Bilbo didn&rsquo;t kill him when he had the chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo&rsquo;s hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked this line from Peter Jackson&rsquo;s adaptation of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>&mdash;very similar to the original in Tolkien&rsquo;s novel, but slightly more economical. I&rsquo;m not sure I would agree now that &ldquo;many that live deserve death&rdquo;&mdash;that seems overharsh&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not sure that the reason we should be slow to deal out death is because of a certain near-sightedness; as if someone with farther and keener vision might be so entitled to deal out death.</p>
<p>Indeed, I would probably want to switch the two quantities Gandalf uses here: perhaps it is the case that some that live deserve death; it is certainly the case that many that die deserve life. That alone&mdash;that a great many people are dealt death rather than life when they are born into poverty, when they are denied necessary medical care, when they are incarcerated at rates disproportionate to their crime, when they are killed by the state, when they are victims of violence, etc., etc.&mdash;that alone should give us pause before further perpetuating death. Death, once dealt, cannot be withdrawn; not by us.</p>
<p>I like, too, how Gandalf recommends pity as a sort of default disposition toward those we encounter; not pity in a patronizing or paternalistic sense, but rather pity as a fellow-feeling of compassion for the sufferings or distresses of others.</p>

Though the function of police is purportedly &ldquo;to serve and protect,&rdquo; the reality of policing in the United States suggests a different motivation than service or protection (or, at least, it is not the whole of a community whom cops are serving and protecting): perhaps cops, even good cops, are cops because (as Christman elsewhere puts it) &ldquo;they actually kinda do like force as such.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Thomas Merton (in <em>Raids on the Unspeakable</em>) on the nativity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Into this world, this demented inn, in which there is absolutely no room for Him at all, Christ has come uninvited. But because He cannot be at home in it, because He is out of place in it, and yet He must be in it, His place is with those others for whom there is no room. His place is with those who do not belong, who are rejected by power because they are regarded as weak, those who are discredited, who are denied the status of persons, tortured, exterminated. With those for whom there is no room, Christ is present in this world. He is mysteriously present in those for whom there seems to be nothing but the world at its worst. For them, there is no escape even in imagination. They cannot identify with the power structure of a crowded humanity which seeks to project itself outward, anywhere, in a centrifugal flight into the void, to get <em>out there</em> where there is no God, no man, no name, no identity, no weight, no self, nothing but the bright, self-directed, perfectly obedient and infinitely expensive machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For those who are stubborn enough, devoted enough to power, there remains this last apocalyptic myth of machinery propagating its own kind in the eschatological wilderness of space&mdash;while on earth the bombs make room!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the others: they remain imprisoned in other hopes, and in more pedestrian despairs, despairs and hopes which are held down to earth, down to street level, and to the pavement only: desire to be at least half-human, to taste a little human joy, to do a fairly decent job of productive work, to come home to the family &hellip; desires for which there is no room. It is in these that He hides Himself, for whom there is no room.</p>

			 <p>From Alberto Manguel&rsquo;s <em>A History of Reading</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep down the production costs he [Aldus Manutius] decided to print a thousand copies at a time, and to use the page more economically he employed a newly designed type, &ldquo;italic&rdquo;, created by the Bolognese punch-cutter Francesco Griffo, who also cut the first roman type in which the capitals were shorter than the ascending (full-height) letters of the lower case to ensure a better-balanced line. The result was a book that appeared much plainer than the ornate manuscript editions popular throughout the Middle Ages, a volume of elegant sobriety. What counted above all, for the owner of an Aldine pocket-book, was the text, clearly and eruditely printed&mdash;not a preciously decorated object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m painting in very broad strokes here, but it seems to me something else at play (aside from economics and consumer preferences) is shifting aesthetics brought on by the protestant reformation.</p>

<p>Pecknold’s early compositions and stacked vocal harmonies mirrored Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound technique, just as Brian Wilson’s <em>Pet Sounds</em> and <em>SMILE</em> compositions had previously; his lyrics captured the symbiotic relationship between cinematic heartbreak and autumnal folklore unearthed from the quixotic Pacific Northwest landscape he was raised in.</p>

			 <p>Thomas of Celano&rsquo;s description of the youthful Francis is so good: “That man was still boiling in the sins of youthful heat” (Enimvero cum adhue vir iste iuvenili calore in peccatis fervesceret)! Of course, Thomas may be (is likely) exaggerating, but still.</p>

			 <p>I tried a different scoring pattern on today’s loaf, to somewhat disappointing results. Rather than my usual single, long score, slightly off-center, I tried four smaller strokes in a roughly cruciform pattern. I had intended the four scores to open up more evenly, hoping for a more balanced rise. Really only two of the scores opened as fully as I&rsquo;d hoped, but the loaf rose pretty evenly all the same.</p>

			 <p>Holy Week of any year&mdash;that week of prayer and fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb—always has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, and religious communities. People all around the world were (and still are) dying, and the coronavirus crisis exacerbated existing injustices in our world: poverty, lack of access to healthcare, racism. It was not hard to imagine the disciples' despair, their feeling that the world crumbled before them.</p>
<p>I was (and am) fortunate to live in an intentional community, committed to shared living in an interreligious space. It was around this time last year that we began celebrating liturgy together regularly—weekly prayer services, a Passover Seder, and the Easter Triduum.</p>
<p>Laurel Marshall Potter—colleague, friend, housemate—and I composed the following prayer service for our community. Our community—Jews and Christians, Salvadorans and Americans and Koreans, students and young professionals—gathered on Good Friday 2020 to reflect on the movement of the passion and what it revealed of the suffering of our world. I am grateful to Laurel for permitting me to share this service on this site; I am grateful, too, to our community for affording us a space for prayer and reflection.</p>
<h2 id="opening-prayer">opening prayer</h2>
<p>The way of the cross is an apocalyptic event in that it is a revelatory event. The cross reveals the injustices of our world, the manner in which those in power gain and keep power, the complicity each of us has in communal sin. Yet it reveals too the depths of God’s love. It is not God’s will that this injustice persist; it is not God’s will that the powerful remain so; it is not God’s will that the guilt of sin stains us forever. Jesus’s long walk to Golgotha makes manifest to us who God is: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God of the living, the God of mercy and justice. This God walks the way of death in solidarity with all who suffer, as one who suffers, that they might suffer no more. The way ends on the cross in death—and by that very death, so ends death itself.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-station-jesus-is-condemned-to-death">the first station. Jesus is condemned to death</h2>
<p>Coronavirus has exposed what the poorest and most vulnerable among us have long known—ours is a culture of death. Eager for profits, for consumer goods, for power, our culture readily sacrifices its poor, its elderly, its vulnerable to the market. Jesus, like many today, is a victim of this culture: as religious authorities and the crowd looked on, he was condemned to death lest empire lose its grip on its colonial possession. Pilate thought he could exempt himself from this culture of death; he thought he could wash his hands of the violence. Little did he know his complicity in death is his responsibility for death.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-station-jesus-carries-his-cross">the second station. Jesus carries his cross.</h2>
<p>The poor and marginalized disproportionately carry the burden of the culture of death. Black and brown bodies, women, queer people, people who are immunocompromised, ill and disabled, prisoners, the elderly, and the abused all bear the weight of structures that uphold kingdoms of death.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-third-station-jesus-falls-for-the-first-time">the third station. Jesus falls for the first time.</h2>
<p>Under the weight of the cross, that symbol of death’s reign, Jesus stumbles. His stumble is that of the economic poor, then and now—those who subsist on inadequate wages, who do not have access to affordable healthcare or housing or proper nourishment. The weight is unbearable; he is brought to his knees, and not for the last time. His journey is only just beginning—how, under the weight of poverty and homelessness and material instability, can it be borne?</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-fourth-station-jesus-meets-his-mother-mary">the fourth station. Jesus meets his mother, Mary.</h2>
<p>How acute Mary’s own pain when she sees the suffering of her child! When we love our family, chosen and given, we open ourselves up the pain of their suffering. Our relationships make us vulnerable, and they also make us human. Mary is not absent from Jesus’s crucifixion, even though it is painful, hopeless, maddening.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-fifth-station-simon-of-cyrene-helps-jesus-carry-his-cross">the fifth station. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross</h2>
<p><strong>Cuando el pobre crea en la pobre</strong><br>
<strong>Ya podremos cantar libertad</strong><br>
<strong>Cuando la/el pobre crea en el/la pobre,</strong><br>
<strong>Construiremos la fraternidad</strong></p>
<p>Cuando el pobre busca al pobre<br>
y nace la organización<br>
es que empieza nuestra liberación.<br>
Cuando el pobre anuncia al pobre<br>
la esperanza que Él nos dio,<br>
Ya su Reino entre nosotros nació.</p>
<p><strong>Coro</strong></p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-sixth-station-veronica-wipes-the-face-of-jesus">the sixth station. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus.</h2>
<p>Kind gestures are not worthless. Though much more is needed to interrupt the crucifixions that surround us, we cannot deem small kindnesses unimportant. Veronica knows she cannot stop the parade of death, but she risks drawing near to Jesus to offer a fleeting moment of relief. Immediate, compassionate relief must be part of our response to the culture of death.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-seventh-station-jesus-falls-for-the-second-time">the seventh station. Jesus falls for the second time.</h2>
<p>Again, death’s weight is too much—Jesus falls. He fears for himself, certainly, but he fears for his family, his disciples, his people. Jesus is not free of the anxiety of death; neither are we. Especially in times of uncertainty as our physical health is at risk, so too is our mental health. Worry, anxiety, fear, depression—these and other demons torment us. When we are responsible for the well-being of others, our mental health is only further strained. We feel we can hardly bear it.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-eighth-station-jesus-meets-the-women-of-jerusalem">the eighth station. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem.</h2>
<p>Jerusalem was weak compared to Rome, but strong compared to Nazareth. These privileged women, residents of a politically strategic city, express culturally sanctioned horror and pity for the poor radical from backwater Galilee. They play their role in the drama of Roman crucifixions. Jesus says to them, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.” Their sense of security is an illusion, and their false pity is damning. We are all both complicit and dehumanized by the culture of death.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-ninth-station-jesus-falls-for-the-third-time">the ninth station. Jesus falls for the third time.</h2>
<p>Even in moments of physical and mental strength, we are not immune to social isolation and spiritual desolation. Jesus’s third fall is perhaps the most crushing: it is in this moment that he realizes how alone he is. He has found small comforts along the way—the tears of his mother, the strength of Simon, the cloth of Veronica—but from here on out he is desperately alone. Our culture of death is a culture of isolation, for everyone dies alone. In that isolation is a spiritual desolation; apart from the fabric of our society, what meaning can our lives have? The isolation of coronavirus is a symptom of a deeper sickness: a culture that does not allow us community and solidarity.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-tenth-station-jesus-is-stripped-of-his-clothes">the tenth station. Jesus is stripped of his clothes.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a socialist.<br>
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a trade unionist.<br>
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a Jew.<br>
Then they came for me—<br>
and there was no one left to speak for me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having robbed us of our solidarity, the culture of death, when it comes for us, strips us of all pretense of security, of control, and of belonging. We fear the day that our illusion of invincibility is stripped from us.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-eleventh-station-jesus-is-nailed-to-the-cross">the eleventh station. Jesus is nailed to the cross.</h2>
<p>The nails by which Jesus is fixed to the cross is the physical pain and torture by which empire keeps its power. Jesus was a discontent, a threat, a rabble rouser—he was a problem that required a “just” solution. Crucifixion—state-sanctioned violence—is that “justice,” a demonic perversion of God’s true justice. Jesus cries out as the nails pierce his flesh, but the soldiers care not; he gasps for breath as the cross is lifted up, but the crowd jeers still. Empire has power; empire keeps power. It is the way of the world.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-twelfth-station-jesus-dies-on-the-cross">the twelfth station. Jesus dies on the cross.</h2>
<p>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?” The Gospel writers cite the psalmist in the moment of Jesus’s death on the cross, and claim that Jesus really does die—he goes to the place of the dead. He dies torn between belief in a God who has promised life and the reality of his own death.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-thirteenth-station-jesus-is-taken-down-from-the-cross">the thirteenth station. Jesus is taken down from the cross.</h2>
<p>After all this, the long walk from Pilate’s court to Golgotha, the end is almost anticlimactic. Jesus dies, not without a shout, but he dies nonetheless. What remains verges on mundane—he must be removed from the cross, arrangements must be made, a funeral must be planned. There will be time enough to grieve later; for now, there are things to be done. There is a numbness; someone who was once a fixture of our lives is now gone.</p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="the-fourteenth-station-jesus-is-placed-in-the-tomb">the fourteenth station. Jesus is placed in the tomb.</h2>
<p>I remember one time at a funeral in Santa Tecla: a family stood around their grandmother’s grave as the gravediggers began to shovel dirt on top of her lowered coffin. As the dirt fell and hit the bottom, the thud was the only sound we could hear. The finality of the dirt on the coffin was the only real thing in the world. It was a final goodbye. The disciples must have felt this same kind of grief at the finality of Jesus’s death and the end of what they thought was the call of their lives.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>V. El sacrificio verdadero es un corazón penitente.<br>
℟. Dios, tú no despreciarás un corazón penitente y roto.</p>
<h2 id="closing-prayer">closing prayer</h2>
<p>The disciples were sure it was over. Even if Jesus’s voice echoed in their heads, it was just that—an echo. There was little else they could do but return to their fishing nets and try to carry on with some semblance of a normal life. Even though Jesus defied their expectations in life, still they could not imagine a reality beyond death. That’s what death meant. It was over.</p>
<p>As the disciples could not imagine a future for Jesus beyond his death, neither can we imagine a future beyond the cultures of death that constrain our lives.</p>
<p>Walking this way of the cross with Jesus, we see the pervasiveness of this death culture. We have seen the seemingly insurmountable power of injustice, and we have witnessed our own complicity in that injustice. It seems foolish to hope that it could be otherwise, that we could be freed of the structures of sin that constrain our freedom and flourishing, that the systems of injustice could be dismantled. Who will beat the guns into plowshares when there are wars to be fought?</p>
<p>Yet this is our hope. This is what God has promised, again and again in the Law and in the Prophets and in the Gospels. We know not when or how, but we do know this—God always finds the unlooked-for solution. God always creates new realities and paradigms beyond our imaginative capacities to be in relationship with us. This is our hope, foolish though it may seem, that God will do good on God’s promise. On this darkest of days, out of the very depths of despair, we can but cry our foolish hope: “Hosanna, hosanna in the highest.”</p>
<p>℟. Glory be to God, now and forever. Amen.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Dear C—,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This past Sunday, on a cool and bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism—something in which you had no say and of which you have no memory—creeping into your life in strange and unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all. I write this note in the hope it can offer some guidance here. Given the subject matter, this note is woefully short (despite its length!), but I hope it&rsquo;s helpful even still.</p>
<p>The joys of life are many, and you&rsquo;ll come to learn these in time—riding a bike without training wheels, enjoying a meal you helped to prepare, reading a book your mom loved when she was your age. But when you have enjoyed all life has to offer and when you come to the end of your time on earth, there life&rsquo;s final obligation imposes itself. If you&rsquo;ll allow me to be blunt: all living things—human beings, animals, plants—must die. Even nonliving things tend toward decay—given enough time, rocks break down into sand, stars explode into stardust, houses fall apart. This is an unfortunate, tragic, unsettling fact, but a fact nonetheless.</p>
<p>But it is exactly because of this burden of death that your parents had you baptized. Baptism, you see, is a remedy to the death into which all living things are born. When you were baptized, water was poured over your head three times. This ritual symbolically—though as Catholics we really ought to say &ldquo;sacramentally&rdquo;—puts the person being baptized to death; when she is lifted out of the baptismal font, she is raised to new life and made a member of the community founded by Christ and made up of all the baptized. This community—which we call &ldquo;the church&rdquo;—is freed by baptism from the reign of death and liberated into a reign of life. The freedom of the Christian is a freedom to live in and by the love of God—a love that is totally selfless and pure, concerned never for itself but always for the other.</p>
<p>But just as being born naturally imposed upon you an obligation of death, so does being reborn sacramentally impose upon you an obligation. And as you would expect, the obligation baptism imposes is exactly the opposite of the one imposed by being born: the baptized are obliged to live!</p>
<p>Christians have a peculiar understanding of what it is to live; peculiar, at least, according to how the rest of the world tends to think of what it is to live. For Christians to live, they must live for others—they must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger, visit the imprisoned. (For more on this, see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=RSVCE">chapter 25 of Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel</a>; or the Sermon on the Mount, found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=RSVCE">chapters 5–7 of the same Gospel</a>.) And very often, Christians must inconvenience themselves to live in this way—they must feed the hungry with their own food, clothe the naked with their own clothing, take the stranger into their own home, and visit the imprisoned on their own time. (St. Basil the Great says the unworn jacket in your closet rightfully belongs to the poor person who has no jacket!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) In this way, the life you received in your baptism is not so much yours as it is others', especially those most in need of your help.</p>
<p>This obligation to live liberates us from the relentless rhythm of decay, that dirge of death according to which the rest of the world marches. Yet that baptismal obligation is not always pleasant—as I&rsquo;ve just suggested, it involves a personal cost to the Christian. You may find yourself with less food than you might otherwise have because you&rsquo;ve given some to your hungry neighbor, for example. What&rsquo;s more, you may find the task itself unpleasant. The hungry might lack table manners, or the poor decorum; the stranger&rsquo;s unusual customs might confuse you, and the prisoner&rsquo;s past might frighten. (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul">St. Vincent de Paul has some really lovely words on this</a>; I remain forever haunted by his claim: &ldquo;It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.&rdquo; I have tears in my eyes as I recall my own failings in this respect.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another reason why we might shy away from baptism&rsquo;s obligation (and many, regrettably, do). The obligation of baptism to live runs directly contrary to the world and its designs. Unlike the white garment of life that the baptized wear, the world wears a death shroud and, wittingly or not, the world seeks to shroud more of the living in death. There&rsquo;s a reason, after all, that there are people without enough food, or too poor for clothing or a home, or lacking the freedom you enjoy. For the Christian to live her life for others, then, and for her to spread life in a world of death, is a subversive, even dangerous, undertaking. Indeed, the Christian seeks nothing less than liberation for all those bound by chains of death: liberation from hunger and poverty, and, yes, from the literal chains of the prison yard. The Christian seeks to undo, once and for all, the pattern of death in the world. (For more on this, see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A47-55&amp;version=RSVCE">Mary&rsquo;s Magnificat toward the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke</a>.)</p>
<p>This is the sort of subversive, dangerous trouble Jesus got himself into. He came into a world of death preaching a message of life and love; he rejected the status quo and sought to undo the patterns of death that keep all, oppressors and oppressed alike, in chains. But the powers that be would not stand for it; they dealt with the problem in the only way they knew how, and they had him killed. Ironically, it was this very act of violence against life that assured the final victory of life over death (but that&rsquo;s another email for another time; in the meantime, you might take a look at <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A35-58&amp;version=RSVCE">chapter 15 of Paul&rsquo;s First Letter to the Corinthians, especially verses 35 and following</a>).</p>
<p>The life that your baptism demands of you is subversive: for this reason, the world may try to stop you, as it did Jesus. There will be some who take advantage of your generosity; there will be some who ridicule you for what they take to be foolishness on your part; there may even be some who commit acts of violence against you, so desperate will they be to stop the liberation you bring. I hope this is not the case for you; but I also hope that you take the demands of your baptism seriously, and that you live the life you have been freed to live. St. Irenaeus, one of the first theologians in the church&rsquo;s history, said that the glory of God is the human being fully alive. I hope you glorify God in all that you do by rejecting death and choosing to be fully alive for the liberation of yourself and of all.</p>
<p>Perhaps you find yourself inspired by the liberating power of your baptism; perhaps you find yourself daunted at the prospect of such a demanding life; perhaps you find yourself vaguely annoyed at having spent so much time reading all this nonsense! (I hope it&rsquo;s not that last one, but I&rsquo;m aware it&rsquo;s at least a possibility.) However you respond to this—whether positively, negatively, or even indifferently—I hope you know there are people in your life who will always be available to talk to you about this. Your mom and dad rightly saw the good of baptism and so decided it was for you; your aunt V— and uncle B— as your godparents, have a special responsibility to guide you in matters of faith and spirituality; and I hope you&rsquo;ll think of me as someone you can talk to about this. I promise you&rsquo;ll always find in these people generous listeners, patient conversation partners, and loving family members. I look forward to the day we can talk about some of this, but until then I remain—</p>
<p>your uncle by law and your brother in Christ,<br>
Drew</p>

			 <p>In the very year of our engagement, <em>Lady Bird</em> was released.<br>
Toward the end of this magnanimous film<br>
the titular character meets with her English teacher, Sister Sarah Joan,<br>
to discuss a short story she wrote for class.<br>
That wise nun comments how clearly<br>
Lady Bird’s love for Sacramento comes through,<br>
much to Lady Bird’s—and the viewer’s—surprise.<br>
Up till now we have seen Lady Bird straining<br>
at the borders of her hometown<br>
and dreaming of going to college<br>
where there is, as she puts it, “culture”—<br>
somewhere like New York City,<br>
or at least, she says naively, Connecticut.<br>
Unwilling to call what she feels for Sacramento love,<br>
Lady Bird demurs, saying,<br>
“I guess I pay attention.”
Sister Sarah Joan, sage-like, responds,<br>
“Don’t you think maybe they are the same thing?<br>
Love and attention?”</p>
<p>Jacqueline,<br>
whom I now have the great and singular joy to call my wife,<br>
is someone who pays attention.<br>
How else to explain her acute focus,<br>
an enviable ability to block out all distractions and interruptions?<br>
How else to explain her fascination with<br>
and appreciation for art in all its forms,<br>
her own deeply-felt artistic expression in song and in dance?<br>
Indeed it is by this very attention<br>
that Jacqueline sees the world insightfully and perceptively,<br>
that she recognizes with clarity the virtues and vices and motivations<br>
of those whom she encounters in life and in literature.<br>
I recall our earliest conversations at St. Bonaventure,<br>
where we sat in Hickey Dining Hall<br>
long after our plates had been emptied and our stomachs filled,<br>
as we canvassed literature, film, television, and, most of all, music.<br>
Though I did not realize it at the time,<br>
what drew me to her,<br>
besides her evident beauty—<br>
and the prospect of dating a third-generation SBU legacy—<br>
was her keen sense of the world, borne out of a piercing eye.<br>
It was breathtaking,<br>
enlightening,<br>
challenging,<br>
delighting.</p>
<p>In what can only be called a miracle of divine grace,<br>
Jacqueline has turned her attentive gaze to me.<br>
To be beheld by Jacqueline is thrilling.<br>
She is a source of comfort,<br>
sharing in my hopes and joys, my griefs and anxieties.<br>
She provides refuge from the lonely, isolating, solitary world I inhabit<br>
of dusty books and long-forgotten names.<br>
Under her eyes, I am not anonymous;<br>
I am seen.<br>
But to be beheld by Jacqueline can be frightening indeed.<br>
Jacqueline sees right through all my pretenses,<br>
through the false self by which I delude<br>
(or attempt to delude)<br>
the world and myself.<br>
She knows when I complain about my colleagues<br>
I really give voice to my own insecurities.<br>
She knows my impatience with others<br>
only masks my own frustration with myself.<br>
I cannot but read myself into<br>
the lover of the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song+of+Songs+2%3A8-10%2C+14%2C+16a%3B+8%3A6-7a&amp;version=NABRE">Song of Songs</a>;<br>
in the eyes of his beloved, he delights:<br>
“How beautiful you are, my love, how beautiful!<br>
Your eyes are doves!” (1:15).<br>
But from those very eyes, he shrinks:<br>
“Turn your eyes away from me, for they disturb me” (6:5).<br>
Jacqueline sees me, and so I delight.<br>
Yet it is precisely because she sees me that I cower,<br>
for she misses nothing—<br>
not my shame, nor my sin.</p>
<p>Jacqueline,<br>
in other words,<br>
sees me not only as I am now—<br>
sinful indeed and a poor excuse for a Christian—<br>
but also as I could be; rather, as I should be.<br>
Her probing stare exhorts me to be who I am created to be—<br>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A1-12a&amp;version=NABRE">poor in spirit and meek</a>,<br>
hungering and thirsting for justice,<br>
clean of heart and peacemaking.<br>
Sometimes she does this outright,<br>
gently and charitably chiding me when I deserve it—<br>
but most times it is her modeling of Christian discipleship,<br>
her lived embodiment of those beatitudes<br>
that points me away from sin and darkness<br>
and toward righteousness and light.<br>
Saint Francis of Assisi is attributed as saying,<br>
“Preach the Gospel always;<br>
when necessary, use words.”<br>
Though he surely uttered no such thing,<br>
Jacqueline lives that proverb ceaselessly.</p>
<p>Indulge me still further.<br>
Marriage,<br>
as a sacrament in the Catholic sense,<br>
is shaped and normed by the cross.<br>
In all sacraments, no less marriage,<br>
we die on the cross with Christ,<br>
and with him leave behind an empty tomb.<br>
In our sacramental dying and rising<br>
is anticipated our physical dying and rising.<br>
Every time a sinner submits to baptism’s watery grave,<br>
every time the one bloody sacrifice is celebrated<br>
with the unbloody words <em>hoc est corpus meum</em>,<br>
every time two persons die to their selves<br>
and consent to the union in which they rise together as one,<br>
Death’s claim over us is broken.<br>
This is God’s wisdom, foolishness to the world,<br>
that by Death itself God should bring life.<br>
Rightly does the Apostle Paul—and do we—<br>
rejoice with words mocking:<br>
“Where, O Death, is your sting?”</p>
<p>Put otherwise,<br>
the process of dying and rising in the sacraments<br>
is nothing other than the process of entering into eternal life,<br>
wherein the last enemy Death finally is defeated.<br>
To be married in this life is to be made ready<br>
for <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+19&amp;version=NABRE">the wedding-feast in the life to come</a>,<br>
where we all shall be wedded to the Lamb whose victory the cross is.<br>
In my marital, sacramental life with Jacqueline,<br>
and under the clear, precise, charitable, demanding gaze<br>
by which Jacqueline attends to me,<br>
I work out the salvation Christ has wrought.<br>
I am not saved except for her love,<br>
that is to say her <em>attention</em>,<br>
a love and attention that reform me<br>
not in in her image or in mine,<br>
but in the image of the LORD.<br>
This is God’s providential plan for me;<br>
these are the means by which God,<br>
in His mercy,<br>
has ordained that I shall be saved.<br>
It could not be otherwise.<br>
Without Jacqueline I turn my face from His face,<br>
to my own peril;<br>
with her, I shall look upon the face of the LORD as a friend,<br>
in life eternal.<br>
I know not why God has entrusted her to my care—<br>
for I, as Jacqueline’s spouse, must do the same for her—<br>
but thanks be that God has seen fit to entrust me to hers.</p>
