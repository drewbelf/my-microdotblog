			 <p>Beatrice Marovich&rsquo;s post <a href="https://beatricemarovich.substack.com/p/ai-and-the-illusion-of-religious">on AI &amp; religious education</a> is very interesting on several counts. I especially appreciate her point about how teaching in the humanities can help cultivate &ldquo;reflexivity&rdquo; in students (&amp; that this is one reason to be way of too eager an embrace of AI in such courses):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want [my students] to feel a little more comfortable reflecting on their own ideas. Not to be neutral, but to be able to reflect on why it is that others might see the same thing (a Bible  passage, a doctrine, a ritual) differently, without also being considered entirely wrong. Admittedly, I do sometimes have students fail to develop this sort of perspective in my class, mostly because they feel acutely defensive about their faith, &amp; they can’t shake the suspicion that as a professor, I am an arm of the infidel academy who is against them. They don’t want to hear me. But, for the most part, students do report a kind of “mind opening” effect, in the course. It’s not easy to get there. It takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>This sort of reflexivity is a common side effect of many courses that students take in the humanities today. They’re encouraged to think critically about the arguments of others, and this drives a critical reflection on their own values, judgements, or perceptions. So my courses aren’t unique in this regard. Courses in the humanities are not, for this reason, simply designed to simply teach content.</p>
<p>This is what worries me, when I imagine possible futures where there are no departments of the humanities anymore. &amp; perhaps where people are learning how to think about religious &amp; theological ideas primarily through some form of AI. If someone doesn’t opt in to the scholarly discourse, where does this sort of reflexivity happen? How does it become part of thinking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon I want to write a longer post about a similar worry I have about AI in teaching &amp; critical thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My brother bishops &amp; I have <a href="https://www.usccb.org/resources/letter-congress-regarding-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-may-20-2025">repeatedly</a> &amp; consistently urged lawmakers to use the budget reconciliation process to help families in need &amp; to change course on aspects of the bill that fail the poor and vulnerable. The final version of the bill includes unconscionable cuts to healthcare &amp; food assistance, tax cuts that increase inequality, immigration provisions that harm families and children, &amp; cuts to programs that protect God’s creation. The bill, as passed, will cause the greatest harm to those who are especially vulnerable in our society. As its provisions go into effect, people will lose access to healthcare &amp; struggle to buy groceries, family members will be separated, &amp; vulnerable communities will be less prepared to cope with environmental impacts of pollution &amp; extreme weather. More must be done to prevent these devastating effects.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church’s teaching to uphold human dignity &amp; the common good compels us to redouble our efforts &amp; offer concrete help to those who will be in greater need &amp; continue to advocate for legislative efforts that will provide better possibilities in the future for those in need.</p>

			 <p>Drimmer &amp; Nygren on the human dimension of education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that learning is something akin to the prolonged process of embodied cognition that cuts across accumulated experience, instantaneous calculus, acculturation, &amp; institutionalized education, which combined allow someone to operate in the world. This goes from knowing not to eat raw chicken &amp; “don’t pick up the long scaly things with fangs” to “buckle the seat belt before pulling out of the driveway.” But it also encompasses sentiments like “I relate to Hamlet because I too have wondered what it would be like to commit suicide &amp; stop existing” or “how did we go back to making literature in the wake of the Bubonic Plague? I can imagine it would have been hard to make ‘art’ in 1350.” All those things are the product of a process of “learning.” Some of it is lived, some institutionalized, &amp; some of it is a natural human instinct for survival &amp; empathy. If that is what we mean by “learning,” it is vital that at every turn we insist upon the humanity of the process.</p>

			 <p>Sonja Drimmer &amp; Christopher J. Nygren on why, <em>pace</em> certain AI company CEOs, we will not see an LLM with &ldquo;PhD-level intelligence&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a particular paradox that makes AI essentially useless as a tool for studying history. The entire point of what we do as historians is to look for <em>untold stories</em> … elements of the history of mankind that are novel &amp; unexpected. There is a fundamental epistemological disjuncture between what PhD-holding historians do &amp; what ChatGPT &amp; its ilk do: the former meticulously, purposefully, &amp; rigorously comb through a mountain of human-curated documents looking for revealing details that diverge from the baseline, offer indications of cultural shift, or elements humanity embedded in seemingly mundane activities; the latter processes terabytes of machine-harvested data in order to predict what will be the most likely next token in a string, &amp; when these tokens are words they may or may not result in a grammatically coherent sentence.</p>

			 <p>On mass deportations as societal poison (<a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/religion-ice-raids-immigration-hoover-los-angeles-trump">commonwealmagazine.org</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope John Paul II, no progressive by anyone’s standards, described mass deportation in his encyclical <em>Veritatis splendor</em> as an “intrinsic evil,” that is, something that can never be justified. Some more conservative Catholic thinkers today argue that the pope was not talking about the mass deportation efforts of today, noting that the term appears alongside ethnic cleansing and genocide in the text (no. 80). The situation he had in mind, they argue, was what he witnessed as a young man in Europe during and after World War II, when governments expelled people from ethnic groups or cultural communities they simply did not want. But <em>Veritatis splendor</em> also cites Vatican II’s <em>Gaudium et spes</em> from 1965, where “deportation” (likely mass deportation) appears on a list of “infamies” that violate human dignity, along with subhuman living conditions, slavery, &amp; human trafficking (27). The argument also misses similarities between World War II–era efforts to expel certain ethnic groups &amp; the ambition of at least some figures in the Trump administration to rid the country of immigrants from certain countries. The target of the administration’s mass-deportation campaign is ethnically specific—three quarters Latin American &amp; half Mexican. &amp; the government has banned citizens from twelve other countries from even entering the United States. Whatever John Paul II had in mind, today’s mass-deportation campaign seems to fit.</p>
<p>In the passage John Paul II cited from <em>Gaudium et spes</em>, mass deportation &amp; other social injustices are said to “poison human society” (27). All of the disruptions to life in Los Angeles, including those empty pews, are proving him right.</p>

			 <p>Phil Christman <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/a-miscellany-for-the-day-after-no">on nationalism &amp; patriotism</a>, quoting Orwell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>By “nationalism” I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects &amp; that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled “good” or “bad.” But secondly—&amp; this is much more important—I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good &amp; evil &amp; recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its interests.</em></p>
<p>“Nation or other unit” is important here. Conservatism is associated in the popular mind with “patriotism”—an association that somehow persists even when conservative politicians openly state their hatred of so many distinct American groups (city dwellers, liberals, leftists, queer people of various stripes, black people they don’t personally vibe with, Latinos they don’t personally vibe with, the majority of women, people who aren’t nominally Christian, people who are so Christian that they oppose being ruled by misanthropic freaks) that the total ends up an overwhelming majority of actually existing Americans. The America that Donald Trump loves doesn’t exist; it’s a projection of his ego. But that’s the unit that he’s nationalistic about. Orwell goes on:</p>
<p><em>Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism. &hellip; By ‘patriotism’ I mean devotion to a particular place &amp; a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily &amp; culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power &amp; more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.</em></p>

			 <p>Dan Walden, <a href="https://danielwalden.substack.com/p/on-what-teaching-is-and-isnt">on the impossibility of AI to educate</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate reason for this inability is that education is a two-way process. It is the less measurable &amp; more important element of school &amp; university life because it is a human relationship that changes all parties involved. In brushing up against a definite other self we learn what we are &amp; what we are not &amp; what we might be: we see ourselves more clearly as one self embedded among many. One cannot see one’s humanity more clearly by treating as human something that fundamentally isn’t. An AI doesn’t make us more conscious of human faculties; it encourages a murky understanding of the two because its programmers want to create the illusion of human thinking. It has no self for us to brush against. It cannot imagine its way into our heads; it does not see us more clearly than we ourselves do &amp; give us what we need, the way a great teacher seems to do. It is ineducable &amp; therefore cannot educate, because the teacher &amp; student are engaged in the same activity: we know this from the fact that this activity can be the basis for friendship between them.</p>

			 <p>Phil Christman <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/a-miscellany-for-the-beginning-of">on Christian public intellectualism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your intellectual life, <strong>expect God to defend himself</strong>. You don’t need to do it by avoiding books or topics that might challenge your faith. Fear your own unfaithfulness, but do not feel other people’s disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>Find enchantment</strong>, do not set up a bulwark in defense of it. There is no such thing as “disenchantment.” There is such a thing as destruction, but you can’t live in a world that isn’t miraculously &amp; inexplicably instinct with unexpected life because such a world is the only world there is. That’s why we should stop destroying it.</p>
<p>Regularly <strong>explain what you’re doing</strong> in detail to a member of your family who genuinely cares about you &amp; genuinely isn’t into any of this stuff. (Thanks, mom!)</p>
<p>A lot of Christian churches &amp; other places cultivate a persecution complex that is often premature when not outright delusional. <strong>Don’t hide your light under a bushel.</strong> It’s better to be disappointed by other people’s small-mindedness about your faith than to talk around it.</p>
<p>The source of your value-add—the thing you bring to the “secular” table as a Christian intellectual—&amp; the thing that allows your writing to invite others to encounter Jesus is the same: You should show, in your arguments, that a Christian understanding of your topic allows you to <strong>say something both <em>more</em> &amp; <em>more generous</em></strong> than what other people can say about it.</p>
<p><strong>Pastors who think theologically, &amp; theologians who think pastorally</strong>, are your indispensable allies in this work. They literally show you how to do it. A good pastor pops up at least several times a month with a short essay directed at multiple publics that restates some bit of the Nicene Creed in a way that will actually strike people as new again. The scholarly, the poetic, the expository, &amp; the journalistic mode are all often blended in a sermon, along with heaven knows what else. (Most pastors don’t live up to this description; when you meet one who does, apprentice yourself.)</p>
<p><strong>“Knowledge puffeth up,” but only if you hoard it.</strong> If you believe that there’s nothing you know that you can’t, with a little time, explain to any mildly curious adult, &amp; if you look for ways to use whatever you know to help (or just entertain) other people, you can avoid the arrogance that Paul warns us against. I hope.</p>
<p>This should go without saying but doesn’t: <strong>if thinkers from other religious &amp; spiritual traditions want to be friends with you, you should take that as a big honor</strong>. If, in particular, a Wiccan, Muslim, or Jew is nice to you, you should approach that friendship very humbly, because people carrying a Jesus license have done unspeakable things to those people specifically. Look for ever more refined &amp; generous theories of the differences between you &amp; them, not for easy &amp; obvious ways that they’re your foils.</p>
<p>With all that, you should still be hoping, in some sense, to be <strong>participating in God’s transformation of other people</strong>—in, yes, conversion. Starting with your own.</p>

			 <p>Pope Leo XIV <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250517-centesimus-annus-pro-pontifice.html">on dialogue &amp; doctrine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a fundamental aspect of our attempts to build a “culture of encounter” through dialogue &amp; social friendship. For many of our contemporaries, the words “dialogue” &amp; “doctrine” can seem incompatible. Perhaps when we hear the word “doctrine,” we tend to think of a set of ideas belonging to a religion. The word itself makes us feel less disposed to reflect, call things into question or seek new alternatives.</p>
<p>In the case of the Church’s social doctrine, we need to make clear that the word “doctrine” has another, more positive meaning, without which dialogue itself would be meaningless. “Doctrine” can be a synonym of “science,” “discipline” &amp; “knowledge.” Understood in this way, doctrine appears as the product of research, &amp; hence of hypotheses, discussions, progress &amp; setbacks, all aimed at conveying a reliable, organized &amp; systematic body of knowledge about a given issue. Consequently, a doctrine is not the same as an opinion, but is rather a common, collective &amp; even multidisciplinary pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>“Indoctrination” is immoral. It stifles critical judgement &amp; undermines the sacred freedom of conscience, even if erroneous. It resists new notions &amp; rejects movement, change or the evolution of ideas in the face of new problems. “Doctrine,” on the other hand, as a serious, serene &amp; rigorous discourse, aims to teach us primarily how to approach problems &amp;, even more importantly, how to approach people. It also helps us to make prudential judgements when confronted with challenges. Seriousness, rigour &amp; serenity are what we must learn from every doctrine, including the Church’s social doctrine.</p>

			 <p>Teaching Herbert McCabe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; in Catholic Theology today. No one does a provocative throw-down like he does:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again it is clear that God cannot <em>interfere</em> in the universe, not because he has not the power but because, so to speak, he has too much; to interfere you have to be an alternative to, or alongside, what you are interfering with. If God is the cause of everything, there is nothing that he is alongside. Obviously God makes no difference to the universe; I mean by this that we do not appeal specifically to God to explain why the universe is this way rather than that, for this we need only appeal to explanations within the universe. For this reason there can, it seems to me, be no feature of the universe which indicates it is God-made. What God accounts for is that the universe is there instead of nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, none of this amounts to a Watchmaker God. As a good Thomist, McCabe affirms primary and secondary causality, which is in the background here.</p>

Through this revelation, therefore, the invisible God out of the abundance of His love speaks to humans as friends &amp; lives among them, so that He may invite &amp; take them into fellowship with Himself. This plan of revelation is realized by deeds &amp; words having an inner unity: the deeds wrought by God in the history of salvation manifest &amp; confirm the teaching &amp; realities signified by the words, while the words proclaim the deeds &amp; clarify the mystery contained in them.

<blockquote>
<p>Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons &amp; groups. In other words: the human person is not a mere individual, relatively expansive, with some philanthropic feelings! The human person is a subject with dignity who, through the constitutive relationship with all, especially with the poorest, can gradually mature in his identity &amp; vocation. The true <em>ordo amoris</em> that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A25-37&amp;version=RSVCE">the parable of the “Good Samaritan,”</a> that is, by meditating on <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html">the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception</a>.</p>

			 <p>A Thomas Aquinas scholar &amp; an immigration lawyer <a href="https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/ordo-amoris-wisely-extending-love/">on <em>ordo amoris</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the overall impetus of Christian love, as understood by Aquinas, ought to widen the scope of our concern to encompass even those who might seem distant or unlovable. Indeed, <a href="https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.II-II.Q25.A9.C.2">Aquinas says</a> that love requires us to be prepared to help even our enemies in cases of urgent need. This suggests that the role of theology is not to lessen love’s demands, which appears to be how Mr. Vance is using it, but to help us to understand &amp; answer those demands intelligently &amp; well. The order of love is about how wisely to extend love, not how to withhold it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the tendency of humankind to be self-serving &amp; deceitful is part of what makes me believe that Christianity is at its purest &amp; most beautiful when it is counterintuitive &amp; unwieldy—that is, when it is least amenable to human convenience. The command to love even those who aren’t your kith &amp; kin is an excellent example of just that. The command to serve the weakest &amp; most outcast members of society is another. Thus, the decision to love &amp; serve the stranger, the refugee, &amp; the foreigner with charity is a hallmark of the Christian faith, such that a government crackdown on this work seems to be a threat to Christian practice itself, or an attempt to reshape it into something else altogether.</p>

<p>If we want to ensure high standards of education, the best thing to do isn’t to micromanage what professors do in their courses—it is to hire more full-time faculty, decrease busywork, offer positive incentives for reflecting on their courses &amp; give them better job security.

It is also a scandal how little we have allowed the Supreme Pontiff to shape &amp; influence our political actions, &amp; how many American Catholics are eager to drive out &amp; demonize the migrants in our midst, who do so much to enrich our country.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bishops can take the lead in living out the Church’s teachings on this issue by standing with the millions of refugees &amp; migrants threatened in the United States today. <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/261415/mass-deportations-incompatible-with-catholic-doctrine-cardinal-mcelroy-says-in-dc-debut">Cardinal Archbishop McElroy</a>, the new archbishop of Washington D.C., is right that “plans which have been talked about at some levels…[for] indiscriminate massive deportation across the country would be something that would be incompatible with Catholic doctrine.” The bishops should collectively echo McElroy’s warning &amp; call on the faithful to stand with migrants. Catholics can support measures that will improve border security, but they cannot countenance Trump’s routine demonization of migrants from Haiti &amp; elsewhere, or his plan to forcibly remove millions of undocumented immigrants, or his unconstitutional executive order ending birthright citizenship.</p>

<p>Faith of course tells us that we live in a time of eschatological struggle, facing a fierce combat which marshalls all the forces of evil &amp; darkness against the still invisible truth, yet this combat is already decided by the victory of Christ over death &amp; over sin. The Christian can renounce the protection of violence &amp; risk being humble, therefore <em>vulnerable</em>, not because he trusts in the supposed efficacy of a gentle &amp; persuasive tactic that will disarm hatred &amp; tame cruelty, but because he believes that the hidden power of the Gospel is demanding to be manifested in &amp; through his own poor person.</p>

			 <p>Excerpts from Sean Illing &amp; Elizabeth Bruenig on <a href="https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast/2021/7/12/22379647/vox-conversations-elizabeth-bruenig-forgiveness-social-media">why is it so hard to forgive</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the truth is that forgiveness pertains to a situation in which the person is guilty &amp; culpable. That is when the question of forgiveness actually opens. It does not open up when you have a situation where somebody is not responsible for the offense. That’s not forgiveness. Forgiveness is when you decide to permanently forgo seeking restitution or vengeance&mdash;or however you want to think about it&mdash;for an offense that someone really did commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So whatever forgiveness is, &amp; I do think it is a personal virtue as well as a social virtue, it’s certainly not something you do for your own pleasure or your own health. The person doing the forgiving isn’t getting a lot of bang for their buck. The person who benefits way out of proportion to what they’ve done is the offender.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Forgiveness is not deserved by definition. It’s not something somebody earns. It’s something that’s freely given.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I say that I have four people that I’ve forgiven for things they’ve done to me. &amp; it’s a decision that’s kind of like the 12 Steps program: You remake it every day, &amp; you do it every day. Because sometimes it’ll come to you, the thing that happened. You’re standing at the sink or looking out the window at the bird feeder, &amp; the fury comes back to you &amp; you want to explode all over again. At that point, you have to remake the decision to forgive. A lot of forgiveness, at least as it’s manifested in my life, is me reaching out &amp; being there, &amp; being friendly &amp; warm &amp; open for the restoration of a relationship with a person who hurt me &amp; saying, “I’m still here, I’m not going anywhere.”</p>

			 <p><a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/rather-contemporary-relationship">Thomas Casey remembering Greg Hillis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last few months of Greg’s life were nothing short of remarkable. I don’t recall his words exactly, but he said something to me along these lines—that for most of our lives, those of us who consider ourselves Christians often wear our faith loosely. It remains a kind of comforting abstraction, a cultural ritual, or an ideological commitment. The gravity of confronting one’s own mortality brings into focus the reality of what we believe. The practice of the Christian faith is nothing other than the preparation for death, &amp; in that moment when death faces us, we must decide whether we really believe what we profess &amp; to embrace it accordingly.</p>

<p>For I have come to set son against father, daughter against mother, daughter-in-law against mother-in-law; a person&rsquo;s enemies will be the members of that person&rsquo;s own household. No one who prefers father or mother to me is worthy of me. No one who prefers son or daughter to me is worthy of me.

Then they in their turn will ask, &ldquo;Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or needing clothes, sick or in prison, &amp; did not come to your aid? Then he will answer, &ldquo;Amen I say to you, in so far as you neglected to do this to one of the least of these, you neglected to do it for me.&rdquo; (Matthew 25:42–46)</p>

<p>But that attention also needs to be loving. To me, this means exercising negative capability &amp; trying to see what a book, a song, or a performance is aiming at, even &amp; especially when it misses. It’s love both for the humanity of effort &amp; for the best that can be done. I think that only with both of these modes of loving firmly in mind &amp; heart can a critic hope to write usefully.</p>

			 <p>Very interesting &amp; wide-ranging <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/undecided-voters-and-bored-students">post from Phil Christman</a> today. A couple parts I&rsquo;m especially chewing on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m obsessed with anti-intellectualism &amp; how it distorts&mdash;well, everything, but in particular how it distorts educators’ efforts to do our job better. When we take other people’s (our students’) presentation of a reflexive anti-intellectualism at face value, &amp; drop items from the curriculum or dumb-down what we have, we think we’re being democratic. We think we’re listening. But that’s the whole question. Is “democracy” what happens when you create a system that is responsive to people’s unexplored, knee-jerk reactions, to the cliches they grab out of the handiest mental drawer to cover a near-total failure of attention? Or is democracy what happens when you give people the chance to <em>actually think</em>, &amp; <em>then</em> we listen to each other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&amp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you’re charging people college tuition &amp; you aren’t making them read long involved things, you are ripping them off by definition. <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/is-this-the-end-of-reading">If reading is “over,”</a> a college humanity teacher’s job is to stubbornly resist this reality &amp; to force it to change, not to accommodate it.</p>

			 <p>I know this is an odd position for a Catholic, but practices of eucharistic adoration like at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/national-eucharist-congress-catholics.html">the recent National Eucharistic Congress</a> make little theological sense to me.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Christ&rsquo;s real presence in the celebration of the sacrament follows from the performance of the sacrament (<em>ex opere operato</em>)&mdash;that is to say, Christ is present in the sharing of the ritual meal that the eucharist is. The change in context that eucharistic adoration brings about (from meal to devotion) seems to undo the logic upon which sacramental validity&mdash;&amp; thus the real presence of Christ&mdash;rests.</p>

			 <p>There are many intriguing suggestions in <a href="https://theotherjournal.com/2024/07/theology-in-retrograde/">Justin Shaun Coyle&rsquo;s discussion of liturgical time &amp; theology</a>, but I especially appreciate his reluctance to reduce theology to ministry, or vice versa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sometimes asked how serving as a deacon in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church shapes the way I read &amp; write &amp; teach theology. The truth is that I cosset a general allergy to the question. Answers to it often decline into styles, &amp; each of these styles court reduction. One style reduces theology to ministry, which of course makes nonsense of the vast majority of theological discourse. Consoling a bereaved mother is, for example, entirely wide of the essence&ndash;energy distinction’s remit. Another style reverses the reduction, as if chanting the stichera during vespers might resolve the question of being’s univocity. But again: why imagine that ministry can only <em>mean</em> theologically? How exactly to think my way out of these twin reductions is not always clear to me. &amp; so I habitually avoid the question of ministry’s relation to theology rather than risk reducing one to the other.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying the previous owner&rsquo;s marginalia to my used copy of <em>Acute Melancholia &amp; Other Essays</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To the following—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To presume, as modern historians &amp; others in the human sciences like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Proudfoot">Proudfoot</a> tend to do, the ultimate validity of naturalistic explanations immediately puts the historian in the position of History 1,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in which other modes of explanation (&amp; hence of existence) are invalidated from the outset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—the previous owner writes &ldquo;yes&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;nailed the critique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If part of the project of women&rsquo;s history is to hear the other&mdash;in all of her alterity&mdash;we cannot unquestioningly presume that our own explanatory &amp; descriptive categories are valid &amp; those of our subject are invalid. Yet the dilemma&mdash;how to take seriously the agency of the other (the goal of emancipatory historiographical projects associated, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipesh_Chakrabarty">Chakrabarty</a>, with History 1) when the other seems intent on ascribing her agency to God (the complexity of agency uncovered by alternative histories)&mdash;remains unresolved.</p>

			 <p>A helpful reminder from Phil Christman <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/writing-how-do-you-even-begin">on writing &amp; novelty</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just kind of read on a subject until I start to have a sense of what&rsquo;s missing from the discussion, what are the little holes that haven&rsquo;t been filled, &amp; then I try to fill them. That is different than coming up with something totally new to say&mdash;a good thing, since there’s nothing totally new to say. Newness is generally a matter of framing and context&mdash;nothing, as I say, is new, but something might be new to this particular discussion, to this particular iteration of this discussion, to this particular readership, to being said in this register, whatever.</p>

<p>Endō indulges a bit too much in the &ldquo;stern God of the Old Testament&rdquo; versus &ldquo;loving God of the New&rdquo; stereotype, but still this is a compelling portrait of the life of Jesus. I want to think more about how Endō presents Jesus&rsquo;s message of love as &ldquo;ineffectual&rdquo; to deal with suffering (at least by worldly standards). In some sense I agree—but still,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>
because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives.
and recovering of sight to the blind,<br>
to set at liberty those who are oppressed,<br>
to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This does not mean a puzzle that we will eventually solve, but a reality that is not reducible to reason, &amp; yet, once received in faith, is hospitable to reason. It is a “mystery” in the sense that it cannot be fully resolved into the terms of reason alone, fully explained—for that would be to explain it away, &amp; ultimately to reject it. &hellip; The use of reason is to come to understand the mystery precisely <em>as</em> mystery &amp; appreciate it as such; it does not attenuate the mystery but allows the wonder of it to be specified, articulated, &amp; received more fully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked in my basket: two zucchinis, an onion, tomatoes, bread, &amp; a bunch of cilantro. It was still half empty, but it felt full. I had everything I needed. I glanced over at the cheese stall, thinking to get some, but knowing it would be given, not sold, I decided I could do without. It&rsquo;s funny: Had all the things in the market merely been a very low price, I would have scooped up as much as I could. But when everything became a gift, I felt self-restraint. I didn&rsquo;t want to take too much.</p>

<p>The practical problem involved might be stated thus: Is it possible, from now on, to maintain &amp; defend, or even to reconquer, the right &amp; claims of leisure, in face of the claims of &lsquo;total labour&rsquo; that are invading every sphere of life? Leisure, it must be remembered, is not a Sunday afternoon idyll, but the preserve of freedom, of education &amp; culture, &amp; of that undiminished humanity which views the world as a whole. In other words, is it going to be possible to save men from becoming officials &amp; functionaries &amp; &lsquo;workers&rsquo; to the exclusion of all else?

			 <p>Brendan McInerny <a href="https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/catholic-education-and-the-fall-of-the-humanities/">on the uselessness of the humanities &amp; Catholic education</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Catholic education aims in no small part to acquire useless knowledge, not because it is less than useful, but because this kind of knowledge rises far above mere utility.</p>
<p>Though this extra-utilitarian aspect of truth can be glimpsed in all disciplines, it is especially the humanities that reveal this to us because their objects all resist complete explanation. The Catholic faith professes that the human person possesses an inestimable dignity, not by international accord, government fiat, vague social construct or on any measurable basis, but because God made us for himself. Our very being bears the seal of God’s own image &amp; likeness. Each man &amp; woman is an icon of God. Seeking to better understand the human person—in all her inexplicable richness through time &amp; culture—is to glimpse in a mirror darkly the divine Source from which we &amp; all things come.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shared governance is intended to protect faculty oversight of the curriculum. Tenure is meant to protect an individual faculty member’s academic freedom, not just in the classroom but also on the Faculty Senate floor. It is a way to ensure that truth is at least sometimes spoken to power. The liberal-arts model promotes education, not just for career but also for citizenship &amp; life. Yet faculty governance is being eroded or simply sidestepped with impunity; tenured faculty members are being let go across the nation in unprecedented numbers; &amp; education is no longer geared toward good citizenship but is conceived of as a series of hoops folks must pay to jump through to get “certified” for some particular job or another.</p>

			 <p>Roberto J. De La Noval on <a href="https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/teaching-for-intellectual-conversion-introductory-theology-at-the-level-of-our-times/">teaching college theology in a secular age</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My thesis is that unless the problem of relativism is addressed head on, the mandatory study of theology will be perceived as completely disconnected from the formation in knowledge that students are receiving in their other courses of study. It will remain for the nonbelieving a (hopefully) fascinating study of mythology &amp; for the devout an invigorating semester of Sunday school, but it will not serve its integrating function of uniting faith &amp; reason &amp; providing a compelling universal vision in which diverse disciplines of inquiry find their ultimate <em>raison d&rsquo;être</em>. It will not, most importantly, challenge the existentially baleful effects of living in a secular age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether my teaching meets the standard De La Noval lays out here; probably it does not. While I&rsquo;m certain there are plenty of students who are baffled by or irritated at my theology courses, a great many (judging both from my course evaluations &amp; from private correspondence with students) seem to find the course engaging &amp; conducive to their own learning. Are these students engaged in my course because it integrates faith &amp; reason &amp; offers an integrative vision of reality? Or do they just find Christian mythology interesting, even if largely irrelevant to their lives? I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll be thinking a lot about this piece.</p>

We have been given the coin of wealth to barter among ourselves for the things we need or want. We assign worth to persons, consciously or not, and then to prestige &amp; property &amp; ease, all the things that compete so successfully with the claims of justice &amp; righteousness, kindness, &amp; respect, which would follow from a true belief that anyone we encounter is an image of God. And the second is that we do not know how to judge or where to blame because events are working themselves out at another scale and toward other purposes more than we can begin to grasp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are we to understand that God resents human brilliance? Considering the question from the perspective of contemporary history, and speaking in the language of the fable, there are grounds for believing He might fear it for our sake. Our tenure on this planet might have been brief indeed if our peculiar genius had had a more hectic flourishing. As it is, our hopes of survival may depend, in bald fact, on the discovery, somewhere, of a new heaven and a new earth, which our great brilliance makes remotely possible in theory. If God had dispersed the collaborators who made up the Manhattan Project, or any analogous project, this earth might be the better for it, or at least viable in the longer term.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/kissinger-catholic-left-berrigan-alaigh">Arvin Alaigh on Henry Kissinger&rsquo;s legacy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Berrigans’ Catholic Left &hellip; saw the ways in which both Democrats &amp; Republicans reproduced war, &amp; they saw that, in this sense, the American electoral system was largely immune to any mass political pressure. For them, nonviolent direct action became an important mode of democratic resistance, circumventing the institutions captured by the war machine &amp; directly targeting the operational sources of the war. Even more, their resistance grounded itself in a mutually reinforcing relationship between faith &amp; political action: faith supplies an inexhaustible reserve of conviction &amp; hope, while political action puts central commitments of Christian faith into practice.</p>
<p>Today, bombs rain down on a captive population in Gaza. At least twenty-five thousand Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children. Despite unprecedented demonstrations against the slaughter &amp; an outpouring of public pressure on elected officials, Washington remains locked into its present course of action-defending &amp; funding war crimes on a massive scale. Our nation&rsquo;s foreign-policy decision-making, soaked in Kissingerian realism, seems to require this massacre of civilians, no matter our rhetorical commitments to human rights.</p>

<p><a href="https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q2.A3">Proofs for the existence of God</a> point to anomalies in a world picture which excludes the God question. It is, it seems to me, quite anomalous to hold that while it is legitimate &amp; valid to ask &lsquo;How come?&rsquo; about any particular thing or event in the world, it is illegitimate &amp; invalid to ask it about the whole world. To say that we aren&rsquo;t allowed to ask it merely because we can&rsquo;t answer it seems to me to be begging the question. The question is: is there an unanswered question about the existence of the world? Can we be puzzled by the existence of the world instead of nothing?

<blockquote>
<p>But finally, for me, the clincher is this: weak or intermittent reading habits concern all of us because media teach whole habits of thought. Media don’t just bring us content; they rehearse us in particular ways of relating to content. The style of relating that reading teaches has a level of distance and irony built into it&mdash;we always know that a book is, so to speak, a translation from reality into prose, into sentences, whereas sound or visual media can fool us into confusing them with reality. The distance between map &amp; territory is already hard-wired into the medium of print in a way that I think is fundamentally healthy. &hellip; If there’s one medium, one habit, that expands our ability to engage with the archive of history while teaching us a fundamentally very complex way of relating to information, &amp; also, is much cheaper to make &amp; enjoy than audio-visual content&mdash;why the hell would we treat this as anything but an incredibly urgent priority? Why the hell would educators, of all people, talk about it as though it were just a funny hobby of ours, something to apologize for?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d like to think more about <a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/issues/issue-21/against-human-flourishing">Paul Griffiths&rsquo;s argument against human flourishing</a>, but this paragraph in particular holds my attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, however, the goods that inform human life are death-tinged, &amp; if those goods could not occur without being death-bound &amp; death-bounded (where would late style among writers &amp; artists be without it? where love’s young dream? urgency of study? passion for knowledge? desire for justice? perception of beauty?), &amp; if the right use of ourselves &amp; all that we come into contact with post lapsum involves seeing &amp; embracing that we &amp; they are death-involved—if all that is so, as it is, then it cannot be proper to attempt death’s overcoming; were we to achieve that, which we cannot, every other good known &amp; available to us would go with it. Death’s transfigurative effects upon what we are &amp; do would be lost, &amp; without them there would be nothing of us as fallen creatures, and nothing of the fallen world to which we belong. Death, as Christians see it, is not annihilation because there is a gift which follows it, the shorthand name for which is resurrection; but still it is not an event in life; it is not lived through. Death’s overcoming by us, however, its postponement forever, would be annihilation: we would be brought to nothing by it, made into something other than persons, <em>comme une pierre, comme une scie</em>, as Pascal writes in his <em>Écrits sur la grâce</em>. Resurrection transfigures death, which precisely means its non-erasure, just as caresses transfigure, without erasing, bodies into living flesh. &amp; mortality, the presence of death in our lives, transfigures those lives, while also, eventually, ending them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question, to my mind, is: is Griffiths right that to pursue flourishing necessarily involves an attempt to overcome death? Might it be possible to incorporate death &amp; suffering into a concept of truly human flourishing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our Life himself came down into this world &amp; took away our death. He slew it with his own abounding life, &amp; with thunder in his voice he called us from this world to return to him in heaven. From heaven he came down to us, entering first the Virgin&rsquo;s womb, where humanity, our mortal flesh, was wedded to him so that it might not be for ever mortal. Then <a href="https://catholicbible.online/knox/OT/Ps/ch_18">as a bridegroom coming from his bed, he exulted like some great runner who sees the track before him</a>. He did not linger on his way but ran, calling us to return to him, calling us by his words &amp; deeds, by his life &amp; death, by his descent into hell &amp; his ascension into heaven. He departed from our sight, so that we should turn to our hearts &amp; find him there. He departed, but he is here with us. He would not stay long with us, but he did not leave us. He went back to the place which he had never left, because <a href="https://catholicbible.online/knox/NT/Jn">he, through whom the world was made, was in the world</a> &amp; he <a href="https://catholicbible.online/knox/NT/1_Tim/ch_1">came into the world to save sinners</a>. To him my soul confesses &amp; he is its Healer, because the wrong it did was against him. <a href="https://catholicbible.online/knox/OT/Ps/ch_4">Great ones of the world, will your hearts always be hardened?</a> Your Life has come down from heaven: will you not now at last rise with him and live? But how can you rise if you are in high places and your <a href="https://catholicbible.online/knox/OT/Ps/ch_72">clamour reaches heaven</a>? Come down from those heights, for then you may climb &amp;, this time, climb to God. To climb against him was your fall.</p>

			 <p>I finally&mdash;<em>finally</em>&mdash; have my Canonet back. The shutter jammed while <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/05/after-about-a.html">in Assisi in June last year</a>. I&rsquo;m a little embarrassed at how devastated I was at the time&mdash;I was so looking forward to photographing that little medieval town, but with my camera broken <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/01/assisi.html">I had</a> <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/02/fresco-inside-the.html">to make do</a> <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/02/the-basilica-di.html">with</a> <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/04/a-view-of.html">just</a> <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/04/flying-buttresses-supporting.html">my phone</a>.</p>
<p>I sent the Canonet to a repair shop soon after returning to the States. Sometime after receiving my camera, they stopped offering repair services but neglected to inform me or return my camera. It sat on their shelves for some months until I eventually received a &ldquo;final warning&rdquo; email, notifying me that they&rsquo;d be donating my camera if I didn&rsquo;t claim it (this was the first I&rsquo;d heard from them). So I made arrangements to have it shipped back to me &amp; found a different repair shop to send it to. The repair took a few weeks longer than expected, but everything appears to be back in working order. I can&rsquo;t wait to start shooting again.</p>

			 <p>Phil Christman, <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/what-is-criticism-for">on looking for an answer to the question “What is criticism for?”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What they’re looking for is an answer that makes sense <em>to the bros</em>. To the people who own the companies that buy these often modestly profitable publications &amp; bite into them like that weird bug Annie Dillard talks about it in <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em> that injects its victims with a liquefying agent &amp; sucks their innards out&mdash;the bros who do <em>that</em> to our favorite magazines.</p>
<p>&amp; the problem is that there’s no answer that will work on the bros.</p>
<p>There is no answer to the question “What is criticism for” that will work on them. There is also no answer to the question “What is education for” that will work on them. There is no answer to the question “Why give health care to a poor person” that will work on them. There is no answer to the question “Why live” or “Why save the planet” or “Why be human” that will work on them. They subordinate their souls, their judgment, their common sense, even their practicality (the thing you’re supposed to be able to rely on businessmen for) to a machine logic that does not finally need any people&mdash;that would be perfectly content with endless gathering of paper wealth on a dead planet with no people anywhere on it, just computers talking to each other. This is the real meaning of Elon Musk’s obsession with figuring out how to prevent artificial intelligence from going Skynet, or with Rosco’s Basilisk or whatever. Artificial intelligence will never <em>be</em> intelligent enough to simply bring about nuclear apocalypse or create Hell for the unbelieving, but <em>guys like him, in control of everything</em>, will do both of those things, feel that they have to constantly do both of those things in small ways every day. Because their job is not to answer questions, render judgment, discern, think. It’s to be “clear-minded” and “unsentimental” enough to just let the spreadsheets think everything for them. If we want human minds with human values to be making the decisions about what gets cut and what gets continued, we have to remove guys like this from power, &amp; replace them with people who understand that efficiency &amp; practicality &amp; profit for their own sakes eventually cease even to be efficient, practical, &amp; profitable. Efficiency, practicality, &amp; profit exist <em>for people</em> to help <em>people</em> do <em>people</em> things.</p>

Some of these (<em>Pillars of the Earth</em>, <em>The Utility of Boredom</em>) should probably be moved to an &ldquo;on pause&rdquo; or even &ldquo;did not finish&rdquo; shelf. Others (<em>Deep Focus</em>, <em>Religion &amp; Film</em>, <em>The Darkness of God</em>, <em>The Philosophy of St. Bonaventure</em>, <em>Aquinas: God &amp; Action</em>) I&rsquo;m reading for teaching or research, but I&rsquo;ve had to set them aside for other, more pressing responsibilities. Of these 13, I&rsquo;m most actively reading <em>1491</em>, <em>No Lasting City</em>, &amp; <em>How to Win at Chess</em> (though I&rsquo;m setting that one aside for now until I&rsquo;ve had a chance to play more chess &amp;, hopefully, get myself up to 800 Elo).</p>

<p>I forgot to move this to &ldquo;finished reading&rdquo; after the fall semester ended. I learned a ton about the <em>Breviloquium</em> teaching it, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s the best choice for &ldquo;Bonaventure&mdash;Life &amp; Writings.&rdquo; I think future iterations of the course will explore fewer theological themes across a wider variety of his writings.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/movies/saltburn-review.html">Wesley Morris&rsquo;s review of <em>Saltburn</em></a> is one of the harshest I&rsquo;ve read in the <em>New York Times</em>, which tends to publish (so far as I can remember) fairly mild reviews. Just look at that opening paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Saltburn” is the sort of embarrassment you’ll put up with for 75 minutes. But not for 127. It’s too desperate, too confused, too pleased with its petty shocks to rile anything you’d recognize as genuine excitement. This thing was written and directed by Emerald Fennell, whose previous movie was “Promising Young Woman,” a horror flick about rape that was also a revenge comedy. So believe me: She wants you riled. &hellip; The question here, amid all the lying, lazing about and (eventually, inevitably) dying, is to what end?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The review concludes: to no end, really. The review is harsh, but entirely fair&mdash;the movie was not good.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256369/full-text-pope-francis-homily-for-christmas-2023">Pope Francis&rsquo;s Christmas homily</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The census of the whole earth, in a word, manifests the all-too-human thread that runs through history: the quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory, which measures everything in terms of success, results, numbers and figures, a world obsessed with achievement. Yet the census also manifests the way of Jesus, who comes to seek us through enfleshment. He is not the god of accomplishment, but the God of Incarnation. He does not eliminate injustice from above by a show of power, but from below, by a show of love. He does not burst on the scene with limitless power, but descends to the narrow confines of our lives. He does not shun our frailties, but makes them his own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would not, now, if I had Frank Capra’s ear &amp; a gasper &amp; martini in my hand &amp; the studio at my command, go back &amp; change the scene I once thought the only major blemish in a perfect movie. It is the climax of a great love story—between people with children &amp; not enough money &amp; frustrations &amp; shameful failures, as many great love stories are. It is a recognition of the unpredictable depths of a woman too easily rated as charming decoration in her own story. But more importantly, it is a pivot within the story Clarence is telling George. For all the extraordinary, irreplaceable good George has done for others, what makes his life finally wonderful—awe inspiring, mysterious—is what has been done for him. He never, after all, set out to win Mary Hatch.</p>

Adam fell fro life to deth: into the slade of this wreched worlde, and after that into hell.

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780300164688">Turner on Julian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps Julian&rsquo;s central theological insight that sin wages war against love because sin is of its own nature violent, but love wages no wars at all, not even against sin, for love is absolute vulnerability. Love knows no other strategy than that vulnerability. For that reason, then, neither is any subsequent reversal of the Cross&rsquo;s violent defeat necessary, for it is precisely in that victory of sin over love that sin is defeated. In its victory over love sin defeats itself. Sin&rsquo;s failure to engage perfect love in a contest on sin&rsquo;s terms of violence &amp; power <em>is</em> sin&rsquo;s defeat, its power being exhausted by its very success. For killing is the best strategy that sin can come up with; it is sin&rsquo;s last resort. The Resurrection, then, is the meaning of the Cross, the meaning that the vulnerability of love, its refusal of the sword, is stronger than sin&rsquo;s power to kill. That is all we know. That is all we can know. The meaning of the Cross neither allows for a fairy-tale ending nor needs one.</p>

<p>Julian &hellip; systematically refuses to finish, because she intends theological incompleteness. And she intends theological incompleteness on grounds that are themselves theological, or at least meta-theological, that is to say, because she knows that what alone completes the theological is also what transcends its powers, namely, the beatific vision. The theologian, in short, is forced to raise more questions than she can answer, for the questions that perforce arise within the limits of theology of necessity can be answered for now only inaccessibly beyond it. Of theological necessity, then, is her &ldquo;boke not yet performed.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780140446739">Julian</a>’s parable of the lord &amp; the servant is so good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the servant is comprehended the second person of the Trinity, &amp; in the servant is comprehended Adam, that is to say, all humans. &amp; therefore when I say &lsquo;the Son&rsquo;, it means the Godhead, which is equal with the Father, &amp; when I say &lsquo;the servant&rsquo;, it means Christ&rsquo;s humanity, which is truly Adam. &hellip; The lord is the Father, God; the servant is the Son, Christ Jesus. The Holy Ghost is equal love which is in both of them. When Adam fell, God&rsquo;s son fell; because of the true union made in heaven, God&rsquo;s son could not leave Adam, for by Adam I understand all humans. Adam fell from life to death into the valley of this wretched world, &amp; after that into hell. God&rsquo;s son fell with Adam into the valley of the Virgin&rsquo;s womb (&amp; she was the fairest daughter of Adam), in order to free Adam from guilt in heaven &amp; in earth; &amp; with his great power he fetched him out of hell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes me want to revisit <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/02/13/for-all-the.html">Caroline Walker Bynum&rsquo;s</a> incredible article on late medieval soteriology, especially her extended reflection on Julian at the end.</p>

<p>Piety is important. I’m a great believer in piety. I don’t mean religiosity or believing in God, though I am religious and do believe in God. By piety I mean actions which we take whether or not we mean them sincerely, because they are part of values we want to practice. We believe in believing in these things, as it were. These are actions that embody things we want to want, or even want to want to want. And these actions transcend our intentions. It’s more important than however you feel about it.</p>

			 <p>One of the best changes I made to my syllabus for <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/23/on-teaching-francis.html">The Way of Francis &amp; Clare</a> is assigning <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780811217248?title=New+Seeds+of+Contemplation&amp;author=Thomas+Merton&amp;cover_id=121897">Thomas Merton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Things in Their Identity”</a> early in the semester. Reading that chapter gave us a chance to talk about Merton&rsquo;s understanding of the true and false selves, which is how I presented spirituality to students: spirituality is the process of coming to know &amp; live one&rsquo;s true self. But besides giving us a working understanding of spirituality, that true self/false self framework has made for a surprising throughline across the course. Students (&amp; I) are constantly referring back to true self &amp; false self as we make sense of Francis &amp; Clare&rsquo;s lives &amp; spiritualities. It&rsquo;s made for some excellent in-class discussion!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>St. Anselm &amp; St. Bernard are the chief influences in our period in making intelligible the spiritual impulses of their contemporaries. But before leaving them, one name must be mentioned which represents the climax of the developments we have been discussing: the name of St. Francis. The period of his public career from 1209 to 1226 lies outside the scope of this book, but he is the embodiment of the spirit of Christian romance which we have watched in some aspects of its development from the time of St. Anselm. The inward quest of St. Anselm or St. Bernard&mdash;faith seeking understand, or carnal love seeking its spiritual object&mdash;was given an external symbolism in the homeless, wandering, unsheltered life of the beggar. The most negative &amp; drabbest of the monastic virtues&mdash;Poverty&mdash;was transformed Cinderella-like into a fairy princess, &amp; invested with the fascinating qualities of a romantic heroine. Above all, the tender, passionate love of Jesus had its earthly consummation in the vision of the Crucified &amp; the crisis of the stigmata on Monte Alverna in 1224. With St. Francis &amp; his followers, the fruits of the experiences of St. Anselm &amp; St. Bernard were brought to the market place, &amp; became the common property of the lay &amp; clerical world alike.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The asymmetry of the Logos&mdash;through whom all things were made&mdash;in relation to created being means that the act of incarnation overdetermines every finite becoming; the transformative reality of the Son resides for us wholly in the Incarnate fact of his being <em>ex Maria</em>. What the Son receives <em>ex Maria</em> does not change the eternal Son; rather it unleashes the transformative power of his divine being into our human world. This is more or less what <a href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/summa/TP/TP002.html#TPQ2A7THEP1">the mixed relation ensures in Thomas</a>: the whole becoming, the whole drama of the eternal &ldquo;is&rdquo; of the Logos resides in the life of Jesus, thus foreclosing (1) every simple transition from the Incarnate Son to the (as if temporally &ldquo;before”) pre-Incarnate Son, while ensuring that (2) it is precisely our human reality that is changed by his divine act.</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Incarnation remains a mystery. But, perhaps, Aquinas can help us to see that we don&rsquo;t therefore have to talk nonsense about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would add (&amp; I&rsquo;m certain McCabe would agree) that this goes for not only Aquinas but for any good theology. Indeed, that&rsquo;s not a bad way to put the task of theology: learning how not to speak nonsense about mystery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our vocation is not simply to <em>be</em>, but to work together with God in the creation of our own life, our own identity, our own destiny. We are free beings and sons of God. This means to say that we should not passively exist, but actively participate in His creative freedom, in our own lives, and in the lives of others, by choosing the truth. To put it better, we are even called to share with God the work of <em>creating</em> the truth of our identity.</p>

			 <p>With the start of the fall semester next Monday, I&rsquo;ve already had multiple nightmares about the first day of class. In one, I forgot to print my course syllabi, so I was 20 minutes late to class waiting for them to print; in another, I ate a Tootsie roll that I could not chew &amp; swallow, so I had a wad of Tootsie roll in my mouth the entire class; in a third, the class was so unruly I couldn&rsquo;t even complete calling the roll. I don&rsquo;t feel all that nervous for next week, but maybe I&rsquo;m more nervous than I realize.</p>

It&rsquo;s a good overview of the sort of Neoplatonic cosmology and Arabic metaphysics of the good that Bonaventure is working with in his <em>breviloquium</em>. Plus, the texts are very similar in terms of style &amp; method. I think reading <em>de causis</em> will help students prepare for reading the <em>breviloquium</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is of the greatest consequence to see that negative language about God is no more apophatic in itself than is affirmative language. The apophatic is the linguistic strategy of somehow showing by means of language that which lies beyond language. It is not done, and it cannot be done, by means of negative utterances alone which are no less bits of ordinarily intelligible human discourse than are affirmations. Our negations, therefore, fail of God as much as do our affirmations.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781952826245">Étienne Gilson</a> on Bonaventure&rsquo;s understanding of the unity of divine ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the ideas designate divine expressions, not in relation to God Himself, but in relation to things; so a certain multiplicity is introduced not into what they are, or even into what they signify, but into what they connote. It is as though the multiplicity of material things produced by the divine ideas cast a sort of diversifying reflection upon their unity, with the result that we believe by a quite natural illusion that we find already formed in them a plurality which cannot really exist since it implies the presence of matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this articulation of a primordial unity to what is, prior to (yet without denying the reality of) multiplicity in matter.</p>

			 <p>James Baldwin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a sense of the grotesque about a person who has spent his or her life in a kind of cotton batting. There is something monstrous about never having been hurt, never having been made to bleed, never having lost anything, never having gained anything because life is beautiful, and in order to keep it beautiful you&rsquo;re going to stay just the way you are and you&rsquo;re not going to test your theory against all the possibilities outside. America is something like that. The failure on our part to accept the reality of pain, of anguish, of ambiguity, of death has turned us into a very peculiar and sometimes monstrous people. It means, for one thing, and it&rsquo;s very serious, that people who have had no experience have no compassion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This connection between the experience of pain &amp; the possibility of compassion is instructive, I think, especially in how <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781506471730">Anne Carpenter</a> then applies it to Christian tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recognition of a Christian tradition that is capable of immense ugliness&mdash;the recovery of our life&rsquo;s pain, of the pain we have inflicted on others&mdash;is, then, requisite for the rediscovery of Christian compassion, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P%C3%A9guy">Péguy</a> simply calls &ldquo;charity.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why have we settled for this strange cultural compromise&mdash;lowbrow genres, done with middlebrow earnestness, in pretend revolt against a thoroughly defunded highbrow regime? The answer is simple &amp; depressing. We have accepted the idea of the democratization of culture&mdash;we have accepted, rightly, that, say, opera is not inherently worthier than jazz, that superhero comics are not inherently dumb, that ancient epic poetry is not automatically loftier than rap (with which it shares some features), that all of these things can be done well or badly &amp; that they serve different ends&mdash;without accomplishing <em>democracy</em>. I mean this in a dully straightforward way. We are not all equally in control of our lives, &amp; we are afraid of what becoming so would entail, of the costs of democracy, of the mess of it. We are divided by class, race, &amp; gender &amp; united only in being the objects of a ceaseless corporate effort to accomplish our commodification. Having lost the economic battle to economic &amp; political elites, we celebrate, again &amp; again, our victory over the mostly imaginary cultural elite that would scorn us for watching <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>. What you can&rsquo;t do practically, you do symbolically, until it becomes a neurosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can say that the mediatory action that tradition &ldquo;is&rdquo;&mdash;the <em>tradere</em> of <em>traditio</em>&mdash;is most properly understood &amp; most properly &ldquo;itself&rdquo; in the present, in the <em>action</em> of Christian existence (in thought, in practice). Tradition, we might say, is alive in the living. Though it is at times characterized as the memory of the dead, its life is to be found in the thinking &amp; practicing of living Christians, a notion that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Blondel">Blondel</a> also stresses. Tradition&rsquo;s value, &amp; what is to be valued in it, is not to be found in its <em>pastness</em>. Its value is what it mediates, is its mediation.</p>
<p>&amp; this mediation of tradition is not unhinged from its past. This is not in other words, the expression of a tyranny of pure contemporaneity. Today is permeable to yesterday, indeed enlivened by yesterday, through human action (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P%C3%A9guy">the poem-plays</a>: the action of prayer). But yesterday only lives on in a specific act of remembering, one where the aliveness of the original is reiterated by being begun again, a beginning-again that infuses the original with new richness.</p>

<p>The staggering thing that this means, for me, is that the most extraordinary fruit of contemplation in the shadow of the violence which we are experiencing is this: God likes us. All of us. God likes me &amp; I like being liked. It has nothing to do with whether we are bad or good, indeed, he takes it for granted that we are all more or less strongly tied up in the sacred lie. In teaching after teaching he makes the same point: all are invited, bad &amp; good. Those are our categories, part of the problem not part of the solution, not God&rsquo;s category. God&rsquo;s &lsquo;category&rsquo; for us is &lsquo;created&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;created&rsquo; means &lsquo;liked spaciously, delighted in, wanted to give extension, fulfilment, fruition to, to share in just being&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This willingness continually to revise one&rsquo;s own location in order to place oneself in the path of beauty is the basic impulse underlying education. One submits oneself to other minds (teachers) in order to increase the chance that one will be looking in the right direction when a comet makes its sweep through a certain patch of sky. The arts and sciences, like Plato&rsquo;s dialogues, have at their center the drive to confer greater clarity on what already has clear discernibility, as well as to confer initial clarity on what originally has none. They are a key mechanism in what Diotima called begetting and what Tocqueville called distribution. By perpetuating beauty, institutions of education help incite the will toward continual creation.</p>

			 <p>Really enjoyed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/07/opinion/indiana-jones-movie-john-williams-music.html">this piece on how music functions in film</a>, taking John Williams&rsquo;s scores for <em>Indiana Jones</em> as a case study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Composing for movies, often mischaracterized as auxiliary to the primary work of filmmaking, is an art form in its own right. At its best, it stands equally with not just the feats of directing and cinematography but also the greatest classical compositions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s especially gratifying to read after I recently reread <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-pauline-kael/">Pauline Kael&rsquo;s review of “Raiders,”</a> which absolutely trashes Williams&rsquo;s score. 📽️ 🎵</p>

			 <p>Gilson on Bonaventure&rsquo;s translation of Francis&rsquo;s <em>ascesis</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imitation of St. Francis could not be literal imitation as he had to omit the extraordinary asceticism and the extreme macerations practised by him: it had to be rather a translation. And this translation itself was possible only provided that some other discipline should come to fill the place left void, and play the part played in the earlier saint by discipline of the body. And, extraordinary as the thing must then have seemed, why should this new discipline not have been a discipline of the mind? Prayer, of course, meditation, already so wonderfully practised by St. Francis; but why not also a new transmutation of learning into love, a transmutation unknown to the founder of the Order because the ways of learning had not been his?</p>

			 <p>Étienne Gilson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What St. Francis had simply felt and lived, St. Bonaventure was to <em>think</em>; thanks to the organizing power of his genius, the interior effusions of the Poverello were to be given shape as thought; the personal intuitions of St. Francis were totally detached from science, but they were to work like leaven in the mass of philosophical ideas piled up by Bonaventure in the University of Paris, to act as a principle of selection, eliminating some elements, assimilating others, drawing nourishment from Aristotle as from St. Augustine, yet adapting both to its use wherever it judged necessary.</p>

			 <p>Caroline Walker Bynum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the guilt-tripping and scapegoating implicit in the late medieval obsession with human responsibility for the death of Christ, there are optimistic and universalist implications in the understanding that that death is representative. If it is <em>humanitas</em> that suffers, if <em>pars</em> is really <em>totum</em>, then <em>all</em> are in the suffering body lifted to God and <em>all</em> are in every self that joins with, that performs, the <em>humanitas</em> of Christ.</p>

<p>While I really like portions of this book, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be assigning the entire text when I <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/23/on-teaching-francis.html">teach my 101 course</a>.

You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.</p>

			 <p>Zena Hitz on <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/the-grace-of-wholeheartedness">reununciation &amp; happiness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feared that if I were not in charge of my happiness, I would not attain it. Such fears were fed by my relative wealth and success. Wealth is dangerous: it provides the illusion of dominance over one’s surroundings. If I can replace something in my household if I simply don’t like its looks, if I can order a car and driver whenever my feet are tired, or fly to Rome whenever I crave pasta carbonara, or purchase a warm blanket at the first chill of winter, I develop illusions about myself. Even worse, if I can transform a landscape with my enterprise, whether by building or by destruction, if I have the power of life or death over others, I begin to imagine that I am a sort of being different from what I really am. I begin to imagine myself as a godlike being who makes reality when I open my mouth or raise a single finger. Yet ultimately my control is extremely limited, as Oedipus learned, by the luck of circumstances and by inescapable forms of human ignorance. Wealth can seem to make these contingencies shrink, but they cannot be eliminated. Dependence and blindness are core realities for every human being.</p>

			 <p>Philipp Rosemann:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me draw upon the register of contemporary philosophy to explain: if Heidegger is correct that the key to a thinker&rsquo;s ideas lies in &ldquo;that which, in what is said, remains unsaid&rdquo; (<em>das im Sagen Ungesagte</em>)&mdash;in unarticulated, sometimes even unthought presuppositions underpinning an entire intellectual edifice&mdash;then it may not only be legitimate but crucial to read a work from its margins, from between its lines.</p>

I wish I had read it instead of listening to the audiobook. The audiobook narrator read in a very performative style, almost like it was a stage production, at times even shouting the words. That approach may have suited Yuknavitch&rsquo;s writing style, but I found it consistently distracting and occasionally even irritating.</p>

			 <p>Dorothy Day <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/scandal-works-mercy">on the scandalous character of the works of mercy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The works of mercy are a wonderful stimulus to our growth in faith as well as in love. Our faith is taxed to the utmost and so grows through this strain put upon it. It is pruned again and again, and springs up bearing much fruit. For anyone starting to live literally the words of the Fathers of the Church, “the bread you retain belongs to the hungry, the dress you lock up is the property of the naked,” “what is superfluous for one’s need is to be regarded as plunder if one retains it for one’s self,” there is always a trial ahead. “Our faith, more precious than gold, must be tried as though by fire.” Here is a letter we received today. “I took a gentleman seemingly in need of spiritual and temporal guidance into my home on a Sunday afternoon. Let him have a nap on my bed, went through the want ads with him, made coffee and sandwiches for him, and when he left, I found my wallet had gone also.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her words call to mind, for me, the words attributed to St. Vincent de Paul (I have not been able to verify whether they are indeed his):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will find out that Charity is a heavy burden to carry, heavier than the kettle of soup and the full basket. But you will keep your gentleness and your smile. It is not enough to give soup and bread. This the rich can do. You are the servant of the poor, always smiling and good-humored. They are your masters, terribly sensitive and exacting master you will see and the uglier and the dirtier they will be, the more unjust and insulting, the more love you must give them. It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.</p>

			 <p>I love this move Pope Francis makes in his interpretation of the parable of the good Samaritan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus asks us to be present to those in need of help, regardless of whether or not they belong to our social group. In this case, the Samaritan <em>became a neighbour</em> to the wounded Judean. By approaching and making himself present, he crossed all cultural and historical barriers. Jesus concludes the parable by saying: “Go and do likewise” (<em>Lk</em> 10:37). In other words, he challenges us to put aside all differences and, in the face of suffering, to draw near to others with no questions asked. I should no longer say that I have neighbours to help, but that I must myself be a neighbour to others. (<em><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html">Fratelli tutti</a></em>, §81)</p>

			 <p>We recently received print copies of volume 80 of <em>Franciscan Studies</em>&mdash;the first volume I&rsquo;ve edited the book reviews for. By the time I was invited to the role this volume&rsquo;s reviews were already lined up, but I&rsquo;m really excited for the reviews I have slated for next year&rsquo;s volume.</p>

			 <p>Interesting series on apophatic &amp; cataphatic theology over at Theopolis. <a href="https://theopolisinstitute.com/conversations/the-eclipse-of-the-word-five-theses-on-apophaticism/">Timothy Troutner suggests</a> a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; apophaticism (represented especially in so-called grammatical thomists like McCabe &amp; in post-Heidegerrean philosophers like Marion) endangers the possibility of revelation &amp; christology. I find myself more sympathetic to <a href="https://theopolisinstitute.com/conversations/fear-desire-and-perplexity">Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt&rsquo;s response</a> (not exactly a disagreement with Troutner, though certainly a defense of McCabe&rsquo;s grammatical thomism), but I&rsquo;ll have to think more carefully about Troutner&rsquo;s concerns, especially since I myself am inclined to the sort of apophaticism grammatical thomism represents.</p>

			 <p>Walter Kasper on theodicy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the terrible experiences of the twentieth century the question arises unavoidably: How can God stand by and watch all this? How could he allow it? There is no easy answer to this question. Like Job we can only keep silence (cf. Job 42). The christology of the Church Fathers shows the direction in which to look for a possible answer. It starts from the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Philippians. There Paul speaks of <em>kenosis</em>, that is, the self-emptying of one who was in the form of God (Phil. 2.5&ndash;11). On the basis of this saying, the Church Fathers developed their <em>kenosis</em> christology. It says: God did not just stand by and watch human misery. He does not sit motionlessly enthroned over a world full of horror. He himself also became involved in humiliation, suffering and death, even unjust death, in order to be near us in such extreme situations, so that where all hope is lost he can give us hope and a share in his divine life.</p>

<p>This is a cool idea; I might try to come up with my own list. Off the top of my head I&rsquo;d have to include Shūsaku Endō&rsquo;s <em>Silence</em>, probably <em>Les Misérables</em>, &amp; something by Thomas Merton (<em>Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</em> or <em>New Seeds of Contemplation</em>). Dorothy Day should be on here, too, &amp; at least an essay by Herbert McCabe.

			 <p>B. D. McClay, <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/you-cant-earn-easter">on the cost of cheap grace</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Catherine of Siena’s <em>Dialogue</em>, God says that “guilt is not atoned for by suffering simply as suffering,” adding that “the value is not in the suffering but in the soul’s desire.” His love isn’t merited through suffering, but simply present for us, whether or not we ask for it and whether or not we deserve it. Grace is equally cheap and equally costly to anybody willing to accept it. And Easter promises us that something has <em>actually happened</em>, that our faith doesn’t simply depend on a conveniently unrealized future.</p>

God has died in the flesh, and the underworld has trembled.</p>
<p>Truly he goes to seek out our first parent like a lost sheep; he wishes to visit those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. He goes to free the prisoner Adam and his fellow-prisoner Eve from their pains, he who is God, and Adam&rsquo;s son.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But this is a grim and narrow view of the purpose of higher education, merely as a tool to train workers as replaceable cogs in America’s economic machine, to generate raw material for its largest companies. Higher education, with broad study in the liberal arts, is meant to create not merely good workers but good citizens. Citizens with knowledge of their history and culture are better equipped to lead and participate in a democratic society; learning in many different forms of knowledge teaches the humility necessary to accept other points of view in a pluralistic and increasingly globalized society.</p>

			 <p>Óscar Romero:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a sorry lot are those Christians who think that their religion is a museum of memories; their only desire is to preserve the memories and not expose themselves to danger. No, sisters and brothers, the church is communion and life; she is communion of life, and her members must confront life in real time. That is life. The church&rsquo;s laws, dogmas, and beliefs must be transformed into life. Those who don&rsquo;t want to understand the church this way are not worshiping the eternal living One, Christ, who will never die. We worship a living God who walks alongside the people, the God who tells us not to commit injustices because if the poor victims of usurers and loan sharks &ldquo;cry out to heaven, I will hear them, for I am the living God&rdquo; (Exod. 22:27).</p>

<p>One day the earth will belong to all people<br>
and the people will be free<br>
as you, God, have willed it<br>
from the very beginning.</p>
<p>This song speaks <em>to</em> God, not <em>about</em> God. It liberates us from the idol of fate in whose power everything happens simply as it happens. It binds us together with a God who is not the all-powerful conqueror but stands instead on the side of the poor and disadvantaged&mdash;a God who is always hidden in the world and wants to become visible.</p>

			 <p>I think Everything Everywhere All At Once will win <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2023">best picture</a> tonight (though I confess I haven&rsquo;t seen Elvis; Top Gun: Maverick; All Quiet on the Western Front; or Women Talking). It would be exciting &amp; encouraging to see such a zany movie win &amp; while I did enjoy it, I don&rsquo;t have nearly the enthusiasm for it that many people do. I thought the Daniels were a little too satisfied with themselves (&amp; it showed), &amp; I&rsquo;m not sure the movie deals with the existential dread of the multiverse as well as it thinks it does.</p>
<p>Of the best picture nominees I&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;d most like to see The Banshees of Inisherin win. It was weird; it was moving; it had a few amazing performances; &amp;, though dark, it didn&rsquo;t seem nearly as pessimistic as did EEAAO. 📽️</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781476706832">Saint Francis</a> by Nikos Kazantzakis 📚</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Love! Love!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not war, not force! Even prayer, Brother Bernard, is not enough; good works are needed too. It is difficult and dangerous to live among men, but necessary. To withdraw into the wilderness and pray is too easy, too convenient. Prayer is slow in producing its miracles; works are faster, surer, more difficult. Wherever you find men, you will also find suffering, illness, and sin. That is where our place is, my brother: with lepers, sinners, with those who are starving. Deep down in the bowels of every man, even the saintliest ascetic, there sleeps a horrible, unclean larva. Lean over and say to this larva: ‘I love you!’ and it shall sprout wings and become a butterfly. &hellip; Love, I bow and worship thine omnipotence. Come and kiss our friars; come and accomplish thy miracle!&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So Rome is always dying (partially) from head down, while being (in part) resurrected from feet up. New forms of life have come from unexpected places&mdash;from Athanasius at local councils, Benedict in the monasteries, Albertus and Thomas in the universities, Francis of Assisi in the lanes and roads, Ignatius alone with a penitent making <em>The Spiritual Exercises</em>, Xavier and Ricci out at the rim of the world, Acton and Newman in pamphlets and journals.</p>
<p>These stirrings of life are not normally inspired, or even approved, by officials. Their leaders were held suspect, their teachings suppressed. Reformers could count themselves lucky if they were only silenced (like Abelard and Newman), condemned (like Erasmus and Wyclif), exiled by church authorities (like Athanasius and Chrysostom), or jailed by them (like St. John of the Cross and St. Ignatius of Loyola)&mdash;after all, St. Joan and Savonarola and John Hus were tortured and killed by them. But it has always been the task of the prophetic church, despite officials opposed to its opposition, to redeem the kingly church. Peter needs Paul&mdash;as Pope Innocent needed St. Francis, Pope Urban needed St. Catherine, or Pope Paul III needed Ignatius. As Paul VI needs Dan Berrigan. The Christian message is not authenticated from a throne.</p>

<p>What if we refused to make the suffering of Christ or Mary part of an algorithm and instead let their suffering stand? A community of memory and solidarity would refuse to rationalize the deaths of the unjustly murdered and instead commemorate their bodies, like <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781626980389?title=Sisters+in+the+Wilderness&amp;author=Dolores+S.+Williams&amp;cover_id=61623">Delores Williams</a>&rsquo;s desecration, as the victims of the blessed brutality of empire. Then <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780140442786">Anselm would need to write prayers</a> for&mdash;to&mdash;the unjustly dead: Emmett Till, Matthew Shepard, Breonna Taylor, or George Floyd.

			 <p>B.D. McClay <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/phenomenology-gun">on the &ldquo;phenomenology of guns&rdquo;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t buy a tool to defend myself because I knew it would make me afraid—not that it would <em>admit</em> fear, but that it would transform the world around me into a world of potential threats. And while in fact I’ve had my share of low-level ugly encounters walking around my neighborhood—from nasty comments to someone blocking my way across the street with his car—I never wished that I had a can of wasp spray sitting in my pocket. If I had to say what I wished, it would be for the people who made it their business to intimidate me to see me as a person, too.</p>
<p>But if I had come to meet them armed, I would not have seen them as people either. They would have been unreal targets of potential violence—<em>mine</em>. And all I really know is that price is too high to pay.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve long wanted to write of mercy and justice in <em>Les Misérables</em>: what distinguishes Valjean and Javert, ultimately, is their different responses to an unmerited gift of mercy. <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/literature/victor-hugos-masterpiece-of-impossibility">Here&rsquo;s Caitrin Keiper for <em>Plough</em></a> on the seemingly impossibility of grace in <em>Les Mis</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main impossibility in the ideal of <em>Les Misérables</em> is not that suffering will disappear, but that it can be redeemed; that brokenness does not erase the hope in any person; that dormant souls come back to life; that the cycle of retribution breaks for grace. And for symbolic confirmation of this impossible reality, there is an intimation of the stars on earth – that is, candles.</p>

<p>To overcome careerism and knowingness [the urge to present yourself as always already informed] and instill in students a desire to learn, schools and parents need to convince students (and perhaps themselves) that college has more to offer than job training. You’re a worker for only part of your life; you’re a human being, a creature with a powerful brain, throughout it.</p>

<p>And, after all who ensnare their blind lovers<br>
in a deceitful and turbulent world<br>
have been completely passed over,<br>
may you totally love Him<br>
Who gave Himself totally for your love,<br>
At Whose beauty the sun and the moon marvel,<br>
Whose rewards and their uniqueness and grandeur have no limits;<br>
I am speaking of Him,<br>
the Son of the Most High,<br>
Whom the Virgin brought to birth<br>
and remained a virgin after His birth.</p>
<p>May you cling to His most sweet mother who gave birth to a Son Whom the heavens could not contain, and yet she carried Him in the little cloister of her holy womb and held Him on her virginal lap.</p>

<p>We are called to be a Church that worships a Jesus who is poor and that serves him in the poor. As a saintly bishop once said: “The Church supports and blesses efforts to change the structures of injustice, and sets down but one condition: that social, economic and political change truly benefit the poor” (St. Óscar Romero). Certainly, it is not easy to leave the comfortable warmth of worldliness to embrace the stark beauty of the grotto of Bethlehem, but let us remember that <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/pope-francis-it-not-truly-christmas-without-poor">it is not truly Christmas without the poor</a>. Without the poor, we can celebrate Christmas, but not the birth of Jesus. Dear brothers, dear sisters, at Christmas God is poor: let charity be reborn!</p>

<p>And it makes sense that in a film so focused on the necessity of a whole social web, of interpersonal love and loyalty, greatness would ultimately be something we ultimately derive from each other—a kind of common property. My friend Olivia quoted the line “your money is in Joe’s house and Jack’s house and the house next door to you.” Harry’s greatness (his war heroism) is in George, who saves his life; <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/there-is-no-mary-problem-in-its-a-wonderful-life/">George’s is in Mary</a>. Where did Mary’s come from? It’s outside the scope of the film, but it didn’t start with her, either.</p>

			 <p>Howard Thurman on forgiveness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does seem that Jesus dealt with every act of forgiveness as one who was convinced that there is in every act of injury an element that is irresponsible and irrational. No evil deed&mdash;and no good deed, either&mdash;was named by him as an expression of the total mind of the doer. Once, when someone addressed him as &ldquo;Good Master,&rdquo; Jesus is quoted as having said, &ldquo;Why callest thou me good? there is none good, but&hellip;God.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Thomas Merton on the goodness of humans &amp; original sin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hate others because we cannot stand the disorder, the intolerable division in ourselves. We are violent to others because we are already divided by the inner violence of our infidelity to our own truth. Hatred projects this division outside ourselves into society. This is not far from the traditional doctrine of the Fathers of the Church concerning original sin! Note of course that the doctrine of original sin, properly understood, is <em>optimistic</em>. It does not teach that man is by nature evil, but that evil in him is unnatural, a disorder, a sin. If evil, lying, and hatred were natural to man, all men would be perfectly at home, perfectly happy in evil. Perhaps a few seem to find contentment in an unnatural state of falsity, hatred, and greed. They are not happy. Or if they are, they are unnatural.</p>

<p>A paradox is just the correct formulation of an issue you don’t understand, and the answer to it is one you could not expect. I think that in any science, paradoxes are crucial. When there is no paradox, there is no possible improvement in knowledge. So the question is how you get into the paradox and how you get out of it.

			 <p>Thomas Merton on Christmas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Into this world, this demented inn, in which there is absolutely no room for him at all, Christ comes uninvited. But because he cannot be at home in it, because he is out of place in it, and yet he must be in it, his place is with those others for whom there is no room. His place is with those who do not belong, who are rejected by power because they are regarded as weak, those who are discredited, who are denied the status of persons, tortured, exterminated. With those for whom there is no room, Christ is present in this world. He is mysteriously present in those for whom there seems to be nothing but the world at its worst.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She [Lilith] stood rigid. Mara buried her head in her hands. I gazed on the face of one who knew existence but not love⁠—knew nor life, nor joy, nor good; with my eyes I saw the face of a live death! She knew life only to know that it was dead, and that, in her, death lived. It was not merely that life had ceased in her, but that she was consciously a dead thing. She had killed her life, and was dead⁠—and knew it. She must <em>death it</em> forever and ever! She had tried her hardest to unmake herself, and could not! she was a dead life! she could not cease! she must <em>be</em>! In her face I saw and read beyond its misery⁠—saw in its dismay that the dismay behind it was more than it could manifest. It sent out a livid gloom; the light that was in her was darkness, and after its kind it shone. She was what God could not have created. She had usurped beyond her share in self-creation, and her part had undone His! She saw now what she had made, and behold, it was not good! She was as a conscious corpse, whose coffin would never come to pieces, never set her free! Her bodily eyes stood wide open, as if gazing into the heart of horror essential⁠—her own indestructible evil. Her right hand also was now clenched⁠—upon existent Nothing⁠—her inheritance!</p>
<p>But with God all things are possible: He can save even the rich!</p>

			 <p>The last of <a href="https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/seven-theses-on-catholic-theology/">Anne Carpenter&rsquo;s seven theses on Catholic theology</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no either/or: God or history, the Incarnation or people of color, the Trinity or the oppressed, all that is divine and all that is just. Catholics need not stop short. We need not refuse the divine meaning surging through history in the forgotten of history. We need not say that it is enough, somehow, to have a diverse humanities, to study diverse sciences, and not to ask what this “diversity” means to God. Our refusal to draw back from the height residing in the depths would be a radical transfiguration of Catholic theology, and also its coming back to itself.</p>

			 <p>I love Indiana Jones&mdash;<em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> is my absolute favorite movie&mdash;but I&rsquo;m afraid <a href="https://youtu.be/y170QEOgYZ4">this trailer for the new Indiana Jones movie</a> doesn&rsquo;t do much for me. Indy&rsquo;s voiceover elicits nothing from me other than a slight cringe, and (judging from the shots in the trailer, anyway) it looks much too slick. What makes Indiana Jones Indiana Jones is the grit and texture. Without that, it&rsquo;s just another action-adventure movie. I&rsquo;ll see it and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be entertained, but I don&rsquo;t have high hopes. 📽️</p>

			 <p>My biggest theological pet peeve is when people attribute &lsquo;penal substitutionary atonement&rsquo; to Anselm of Canterbury. On the contrary, he presents his theory of &lsquo;satisfaction&rsquo; as <em>an alternative to</em> penal accounts of atonement!</p>

<p>Do you suffer from low self-esteem? Do you have anxiety, or difficulty making decisions? Do you find yourself unable to decide whether you should use that or which when composing a sentence?

However, if the source of your trouble is the issue of that and which we may be of some small assistance.</p>

			 <p>I know less about Albert Schweitzer than I probably should, but what a way to end a book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He comes to us as One unknown, without a name, as of old, by the lake-side, He came to those men who knew him not. He speaks to us the same word: &lsquo;Follow thou me&rsquo; and sets us to the task which He has to fulfill for our time. He commands. And to those who obey Him, whether they be wise or simple, He will reveal Himself in the toils, the conflicts, the sufferings which they shall pass through in His fellowship, and as an ineffable mystery, they shall learn in their own experience Who He is.</p>

			 <p>Cyril of Alexandria, in <em>Quod sit unum</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that they [those who subscribe to a Nestorian christology] have turned the mystery of the economy in the flesh completely on its head, for in their argument one cannot see how God the Word, born of God, and God by nature, abased himself to a self-emptying and humbled himself to assume the form of a slave. On the contrary, in their estimate a man is exalted into the glory of the Godhead and into preeminence over all things; he receives the form of God and is raised on high and comes to be enthroned alongside the Father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all the times I&rsquo;ve read this text, I&rsquo;d never really tracked this particular movement in the argument. Nestorian christology tries to protect God from the humiliation of finite flesh in the incarnation, instead emphasizing the exaltation of an assumed man. But for Cyril, the humility is the whole point; it is only by that humility according to which the Word empties himself that humans have any hope of the exaltation that Nestorius seeks.</p>

<p>Donning St. Francis’s rags or St. Michael Archangel’s wings or Mary’s star-speckled mantle—this too reminds the devils of their defeat. Our pastors want us to costume our children as the saints precisely because death could not hold them. Why, then, not also dress them as the enemy, who rather ridiculously presumed death’s caress deeper and longer than love’s? Why not mock the mocker?</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe on the Trinity (from &ldquo;A Sermon for Pentecost&rdquo; in <em>God Still Matters</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God understands, contemplates, his divine life. We can think of God as forming a concept of himself (we don&rsquo;t have to, but we can); we can think of God&rsquo;s understanding as God&rsquo;s conceiving what it is to be God – having an idea of the meaning of being God; God naming himself &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; We can think, as John may have done, of the concept or Word of God that was in the beginning with God, and was God; &lsquo;was God&rsquo; because it was the perfect, utterly adequate thought of God, no different from God. So the revelation of the Word made flesh is God&rsquo;s own idea of himself dwelling amongst us, God&rsquo;s word to himself becoming his word to us.</p>
<p>And then we can think (we don&rsquo;t have to but we can) of the joy that God takes in contemplating his life, his divinity, in the Word – that profound acquiescence in being divine: the immense joy of the eternal God, not now in what he has created or done, but in what he is just in living, in being God. God knows his life and, in knowing it, loves it. Or: in eternity, the Father, contemplating his divine life, brings forth the Word, and through the Word gives forth Joy, the Spirit. So, as a reflection of this eternal life, in history, the father sends to us the Word made flesh, Jesus, and through the Word made flesh, gives forth to us the Joy of the Spirit, to make the Church. What happens in the story of Jesus is the image, the sign, the sacrament of the divine life in eternity. This is the tremendous mystery that the first disciples experienced (seemed almost to experience in their bodies) at Pentecost, the expression of the immense joy of God.</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe on original sin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To believe that Jesus is of God is to believe that, in rejecting him, people are making the most ultimate kind of rejection, the final contradiction of themselves. The crucifixion is not just one more case of a particular society showing its inhumanity. It is the whole human race showing its rejection of itself. The resurrection is the Father&rsquo;s refusal to accept this self-rejection of man.</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe, on God&rsquo;s name:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;God&rsquo;, &lsquo;Theos&rsquo;, &lsquo;Deus&rsquo; is of course a name borrowed from paganism; we take it out of its proper context, where it is used for talking about the gods, and use it for our own purposes. This is quite a legitimate piece of borrowing and quite safe so long as it does not mislead us into thinking that the God we worship (or don&rsquo;t) is a god. We always do have to speak of our God with borrowed words; it is one of the special things about our God that there are no peculiarly appropriate words that belong to him, as with the language of carpentry or computer-speak. He is always dressed verbally in second-hand clothes that don&rsquo;t fit him very well. We always have to be on our guard against taking these clothes as revealing who and what he is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I generally like this paragraph, though I wonder if there at least three words that are not borrowed and so can be used properly of God, precisely because God has revealed Godself as: Father, Son, Holy Spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as a natural death: nothing that happens to a man is ever natural, since his presence calls the world into question. All men must die: but for every man his death is an accident and, even if he knows it and consents to it, an unjustifiable violation.</p>

			 <p>I love this paragraph, from <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307764485">The Married Man</a> by Edmund White (Ajax is Austin and Julien&rsquo;s basset hound puppy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Austin had never heard any whimsy coming out of Julien&rsquo;s mouth before, but now it never stopped. Julien decided that he would raise Ajax to be the next pope. He was constantly on the lookout for pious deeds and minor miracles, which would confirm his calling. Julien started calling him Pius VII, which in French was pronounced &ldquo;<em>Pissette</em>&rdquo; and also meant &ldquo;little pisser.&rdquo; The whole idea was mad and in the worst taste, but Julien clung to it so long that Austin suspected he took it half-seriously.</p>

This is a bit of a spoiler, thematically at least, but: I think of <em>Breaking Bad</em> and <em>Better Call Saul</em> as thematic opposites. <em>Breaking Bad</em> is about the corroding and self-annihilating effects of sin and evil, whereas <em>Better Call Saul</em> is about the redemptive possibility of love and grace.</p>

			 <p>A nice piece by Phil Christman on <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/developing-your-voice?utm_medium=reader2">finding one&rsquo;s voice</a>. His chief counsel is patience. It takes time to develop a voice, and one&rsquo;s voice emerges from imitation and modification of other&rsquo;s voices. Finding your voice also involves figuring out what&rsquo;s so central to who you are that you can&rsquo;t bear it being said anything less than perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever your deal is, whatever you think is true, whatever is so beautifully right to you that it gets you out of bed in the morning (and if it’s just the scream of your baby that gets you out of bed, that’s still a worldview, because somewhere behind all your exhaustion you believe that that baby is worth raising, you believe it unquestioningly, and if you didn’t you’d quit and fail like lots of parents do)—it’s all been said before, but it’s been said <em>a little bit wrong</em>, because it’s been said by humans. So you dig into your experience and find the examples, the details, the concessions, the stories that will proclaim the thing the way <em>you</em> want it proclaimed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you can do this, you&rsquo;ve got a voice. 💬</p>

			 <p>Some pictures of St. Bonaventure University taken with <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2022/04/15/a-recent-ebay.html">my Pentax K1000</a> on (I think) Fujicolor 200. I&rsquo;m not entirely satisfied with these pictures; the color is a little underwhelming to me, which may be a consequence of either the film itself or the UV filter I&rsquo;ve used. The color of the sky is especially drab; it should be more blue than gray!</p>

<p><a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/studentpages/buildings/Friedsam%20Memorial%20Library.htm">Friedsam Memorial Library</a>, where I spend about <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours">3 to 4 hours each weekday</a> reading and researching for my book project. (The other hours of the workday are spent collating notes, tracking down citations, planning the research, etc.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The story I&rsquo;d heard told about St. Joseph&rsquo;s Oratory is this: when construction on the dining hall was completed, the University used the leftover bricks to build this oratory for the sisters working in the dining hall so they would have a place for quiet and prayer between meals. (I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true now, given that <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/studentpages/buildings/Devereux.htm">this webpage</a> reports the oratory as a gift from an Olean resident.) When I was a student here it was mostly empty, though in the years after I graduated one of the friars turned it into a chapel for perpetual eucharistic adoration. I don&rsquo;t think it serves that role any longer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The courtyard of <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/studentpages/buildings/Devereux.htm">Devereux Hall</a>, the oldest building (I think) on campus. Thomas Merton lived here (though on the other side of the building) when he taught at St. Bonaventure just before joining the Trappists. I love how the building almost entirely consumed with ivy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A detail of the ivy that hangs from Devereux Hall. This is, I think, my favorite of the set; the colors here (especially the green of the ivy) are more vibrant, and the light dances off the ivy.</p>

<p>The main quad.</p>

<p>And finally, the bell tower and <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/chapel/index.htm">university chapel</a>. The bells are missing (I think they were taken down for some repair).</p>

Still, I&rsquo;m glad to have more regular access to a library again (and one as good as the Franciscan Institute&rsquo;s in Friedsam Memorial Library!).</p>

			 <p>I like this characterization of prayer, in the fourth book of the Franciscan <em>Summa halensis</em> (q.26, m.3, a.7; p. 720 in the 1622 Cologne edition). A quick and rough translation (verging on paraphrase, really):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Properly speaking, prayer is the ascent of the soul to God ordered to the tasting or releasing of something; commonly speaking, prayer is any act of contemplation related to God; most commonly speaking, prayer is any good act.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three was enough to provide just enough content, but to allow for the imagination of the viewer space to begin its own play. Now, there’s just too much of everything. Once Star Wars represented limitless possibility of imagination; now it’s just another boring action series, of which there are already one million. Here, as with all cultural products, we’re approaching a general glut of the human spirit, caused by the overproduction of boring crap.</p>

			 <p>Willie James Jennings, with a really lovely description of theological education at the end of his <em>After Whiteness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be involved in theological education is to long for eternity and the end of death. It is to seek the blessed state where our words start to do new work by first joining the chorus of the words of those who live forever in the Lord and who sound the healing and redeeming voice of the living God. Then our words will heal. Then our words will build up. Then our words will help form life together. Then our words will give witness to a destiny only visible through love. Talking together then is a practice aimed at eternity, and it matters more than we often realize for bringing our hope into focus. This finally is the goal of this book and the task I want to leave you with&mdash;to bring hope into focus.</p>

			 <p>Willie James Jennings, <em>After Whiteness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theological education could mark a new path for Western education, one that builds a vision of education that cultivates the new belonging that this world longs to inhabit. But we cannot give witness to that newness if we imagine that our fundamental struggle is one of institutional survival, or the challenge of educational delivery systems, or the alignment of financial modeling with our desired outcomes, or the expansion of pedagogical models. All these matters are important, but they are not where the struggle meets us or from where the vision of our futures will come.</p>

<p>Theological education is also about resistance. It is the seed from which may grow beautiful habitation or from which may grow mind-bending captivity. Yet how do you design for intellectual resistance? This may be the most pressing question in theological education today, because we theological educators are failing miserably at precisely this&mdash;at imagining a form of resistance that builds community.</p>

			 <p>I watched &ldquo;part 1&rdquo; of <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> earlier today. While I&rsquo;m enjoying this story more than, say, <em>The Mandalorian</em>, my experience viewing it is basically the same as the other Disney+ <em>Star Wars</em> series: I simply do not find them all that engaging. (The sequel films, especially <em>The Last Jedi</em>, are better in this respect, but they have their own problems; I find <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> unwatchable, far worse than the prequel trilogy.) The major problem for me, I think, is the enormous aesthetic gulf that exists between George Lucas&rsquo;s <em>Star Wars</em> and Disney&rsquo;s <em>Star Wars</em>. Lucas&rsquo;s excesses are probably to blame for the shortcomings of the prequel trilogy (though I don&rsquo;t find those films as horrendous as others do), but the most recent <em>Star Wars</em> entries feel to me more like Marvel movies than <em>Star Wars</em> films.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/topics/faith/devotional-reading/the-way-chapter-romero">one of Óscar Romero&rsquo;s homilies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want peace, but not the peace of violence and of cemeteries, not peace imposed or extorted. We want peace that is the fruit of justice, peace that is the fruit of obedience to God, for God was expecting the righteousness and justice that his vineyard should have produced but got in return only murders. What we have of humanity and Christianity in El Salvador should have produced much peace, much right, much justice. How different our country would be if it were producing what God has planted here! It’s sad to say, but God feels he has failed with certain societies, and I think that the passages from Isaiah and Saint Paul that we read today have become a very sad Salvadoran reality: “I looked for righteousness, and behold, murders! I looked for justice, and behold, laments!” (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Is5.7">Isa. 5:7</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Violence begets injury begets death, and any culture debased to vacillating between violent struggle and idle nihilism is shuddering toward its end as a culture of death. And a culture of death is like a prophecy, or a sickness: It bespeaks itself in worsening phases. Right now, we find ourselves foreclosing upon our own shared future both recklessly and deliberately—and perhaps, gradually, beginning to behave as if there is no future for us at all; soon, I sometimes worry, we may find ourselves faced with a darkening present, no faith in our future, and a doomed tendency to chase violence with violence.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://forward.com/culture/503637/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-uvalde/">Robert Zaretsky, on what a deeper appreciation of the word ‘tragedy’ reveals about tragedies like school shootings</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet if we could wring out the word’s semantic saturation, we might glimpse an earlier and more useful use of the word. A usage, in effect, that reminds us that tragedy remains Greek to us. In his recent book, <em>Tragedy, the Greeks and Us</em>, the philosopher Simon Critchley explores how the ancient Greek tragedians understood their world. Tragedy is not simply something that happens to us, the way that, say, a meteor happened to dinosaurs 65 million years ago or, for that matter, an earthquake happened to the residents of Lisbon 250 years ago. Both events were out of the control of its victims.</p>
<p>Not so with real tragedies, though. The works of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides reveal the human factor in the making of tragedy. As Critchley writes, “Tragedy requires some degree of complicity on our part in the disaster that destroys us.” It is not that the gods did this to us, but that we collaborated with the gods to do this to us. The upshot, as Critchley makes clear, is terrifying: “Tragedy requires our collusion with [our] fate. In other words, it requires no small measure of freedom.”</p>

<p>That horror cannot be blamed just on one unhinged person. It was the sacrifice we as a culture made, and continually make, to our demonic god. We guarantee that crazed man after crazed man will have a flood of killing power readily supplied him. We have to make that offering, out of devotion to our Moloch, our god. The gun is our Moloch. We sacrifice children to him daily—sometimes, as at Sandy Hook, by directly throwing them into the fire-hose of bullets from our protected private killing machines, sometimes by blighting our children’s lives by the death of a parent, a schoolmate, a teacher, a protector.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a problem gets harder to solve, ignoring it becomes all the more tempting. Ignore it long enough, and eventually it becomes unsolvable. Giving up can then seem to deliver a measure of relief, in that it appears, at least for a moment, to liberate us from the agonies of our failing efforts. But such relief cannot last, as the unsolved problem will continue to create problems and cause suffering. This suffering rarely feels like freedom.</p>

			 <p>Maggie Nelson, discussing an interview given by Pema Chödtön:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m riveted by this formulation, &ldquo;the environment was safe, but the teachings were threatening,&rdquo; as it names a paradox at the heart of much intellectual and artistic creation and pedagogy, one especially relevant for those of us who have devoted much of our lives to the contemplation and creation of transgressive work, as well as to supporting and respecting students. You can work to make a safe environment, but if the teachings at hand are meant to rattle, people are going to feel rattled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to reflect on this more in my own teaching. It seems to me that this describes (or should describe) what it is to teach Christian theology, particularly in the context of higher education. It seems to me the commitments and practices of Christianity destabilize the commitments and practices most students enter my classroom with;   they probably destabilize the commitments and practices they are taught by many other professors, too.</p>

<p>Faith is the will to let the past be reborn in the present as more than what until now had been known, and the will to let the present be shaped by a future yet to be revealed. Hope is the conviction that that revelation will not only fulfill but far exceed the promise that the tradition preserves within itself. And, in the end, faith and hope will both pass away, or rather pass over into perfect love&mdash;which is, at the last, another name, and perhaps the highest, for that final horizon that calls all thought and all of creation to itself.</p>

			 <p>David Bentley Hart on tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tradition&rsquo;s life, it turns out, is an irrepressible apocalyptic ferment within, beckoning believers simultaneously back to an immemorial past and forward to an unimaginable future. The proper moral and spiritual attitude to tradition&rsquo;s formal expressions, if all of this is correct, would be not a simple clinging to what has been received, but also a relinquishing, even at times of things that had once seemed most precious: <em>Gelassenheit</em>, to use Eckhart&rsquo;s language, release. Only thus can one receive tradition as a liberating counterhistory, as the apocalyptic exception to bare history that promises believers a higher truth than death: by remembering a first interruption, awaiting a last interruption, and attempting to sustain the theme uniting them in the interval. Only thus can the faithful find the meaninglessness of bare history converted into a completed tale of vocation and judgment, of a call heard from far away that nevertheless summons them to a promised homeland.</p>

			 <p>A recent eBay acquisition: a Pentax K1000 35mm film camera. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get into film photography for a while now, and I was recently struck by an urge to find a good beginner&rsquo;s camera to get started. The K1000 seemed the clear choice for a number of reason: its availability, its price, its simplicity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What I like about this camera is its fully mechanical operation: though it does have a battery, that battery only powers the built-in light meter. Otherwise, the camera operates completely mechanically—and you can really feel it when you release the shutter.</p>
<p>The camera has basically no features at all, apart from the light meter: manual focus, manual exposure. Its lack of features was another selling point to me. I want little more than the absolute basics as I get into film photography. There&rsquo;s something about the bare bones simplicity of the K1000 that seems to lend the photos it shoots with honesty and integrity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a few shots just around town, mainly getting a feel for the camera and testing out different exposures. I&rsquo;m hoping to get through a roll in a week or so, so I can send the film off to be developed and see how accurate the light meter is.</p>

<p>Our own generation enjoys the legacy bequeathed to it by that which
preceded it. We frequently know more, not because we have moved ahead by
our own natural ability, but because we are supported by the strength of
others, and possess riches that we have inherited from our forefathers.
Bernard of Chartres used to compare us to dwarfs perched on the shoulders
of giants. He pointed out that we see more and farther than our
predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height, but
because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic shoulders.</p>

<p>No. 123. Whenever I speak of faith, I am not speaking of faith in God. Likewise, when I speak of doubt, I am not talking about doubting God&rsquo;s existence, or the truth of any gospel. Such terms have never meant very much to me. To contemplate them reminds me of playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey: you get spun around until you wander off, disoriented and blindfolded, walking gingerly with a hand stretched out in front of you, until you either run into a wall (laughter), or a friend gently pushes you back toward the game.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>No. 125. Of course, you could also just take off the blindfold and say, <em>I think this game is stupid, and I&rsquo;m not playing it anymore</em>. And it must also be admitted that hitting the wall or wandering off in the wrong direction or tearing off the blindfold is as much a part of the game as is pinning the tail on the donkey.</p>

			 <p>bell hooks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hearing each other&rsquo;s voices, individual thoughts, and sometimes associating theses voices [sic] with personal experience makes us more acutely aware of each other. That moment of collective participation and dialogue means that students and professor respect&mdash;and here I invoke the root meaning of the word, &ldquo;to look&rdquo;&mdash;at each other, engage in acts of recognition with one another, and do not just talk to the professor. Sharing experiences and confessional narratives in the classroom helps establish communal commitment to learning. These narrative moments usually are the space where the assumption that we share a common class background and perspective is disrupted. While students may be open to the idea that they do not all come from a common class background, they may still expect that the values of materially privileged groups will be the class&rsquo;s norm.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s important to remind students that joy can be present <em>along with hard work</em>. Not every moment in the classroom will necessarily be one that brings you immediate pleasure, but that doesn&rsquo;t preclude the possibility of joy. Nor does it deny the reality that learning can be painful. And sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary to remind students and colleagues that pain and painful situations don&rsquo;t necessarily translate into harm. We make that very fundamental mistake all the time.

As it happens I was teaching evil as <em>privatio boni</em> to my Catholic theology class on the day Putin&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and was put in the awkward position of saying evil doesn&rsquo;t really exist on a day when unspeakable evils were underway. Like Bauerschmidt, I used Herbert McCabe&rsquo;s image of evil as hole-in-sock to try to balance both <em>privatio boni</em> and our real experience of evil as surd.

			 <p>Daniel Walden, <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/one-more-lifeless-idol">in a review of a very bad recent book</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of us [on the political left] came to our politics precisely because we do sense that we have unchosen obligations to the people around us, and some people may have childhood memories of strong neighborhood or community bonds that made it easy for them to wander around safely, or of large family gatherings that included people who were not blood relatives but might as well have been. People <em>should</em> be able to let their children wander freely around safe neighborhoods; they should be able to form strong relationships with their neighbors and fellow local citizens, go to silly productions at the community theater, and shop for the things they need at stores owned and run by people who live alongside them. And if the community where they live doesn’t provide what they need to be happy, they should be able to find one that does. I am sure that such communities, were people able to live in them, would develop local traditions and institutions that would help cement people’s connection to one another, and I view it as the role of the state to underwrite the basic necessities of life for every person precisely so that we will be free to form the sorts of communities that will nourish us and let us form the loving relationships that sustain human life.</p>

			 <p>Paul Griffiths, on the LORD as theology&rsquo;s topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Christians prepare to approach the LORD in eucharistic worship, they do so haltingly, repeatedly underlining in the words they speak that what they are about to do cannot be done. Even after the bread and wine have been consecrated before the congregation’s face and offered to it, and even after the declaration is made that those who can receive the body and blood are happy—blessed—to be able to do so, the congregation declares that it is incapable of receiving what is offered, echoing, in doing so, the scriptural words of the Roman centurion who asks Jesus to heal his servant: <em>non sum dignus ut intres sub tectum meum, sed tantum dic verbo et sanabitur anima mea</em> (I’m not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed). All theological discourse works under this rubric: <em>non sum dignus &hellip; tantum dic verbo</em>. Theologians, whether believers or not, lovers of the LORD or not, need to remember this so that theology, rather than something else, is what they do.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-dawn-of-everything-a-new-history-of-humanity/9780374157357">David Graeber &amp; David Wengrow&rsquo;s <em>The Dawn of Everything</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>American citizens have the right to travel wherever they like – provided, of course, they have the money for transport and accommodation. They are free from ever having to obey the arbitrary orders of superiors – unless, of course, they have to get a job. In this sense, it is almost possible to say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people">the Wendat</a> had play chiefs and real freedoms, while most of us today have to make do with real chiefs and play freedoms. Or to put the matter more technically: what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people">the Hadza</a>, Wendat or ‘egalitarian’ people such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuer_people">the Nuer</a> seem to have been concerned with were not so much formal freedoms as substantive ones. They were less interested in the right to travel than in the possibility of actually doing so (hence, the matter was typically framed as an obligation to provide hospitality to strangers). Mutual aid – what contemporary European observers often referred to as ‘communism’ – was seen as the necessary condition for individual autonomy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Graeber &amp; Wengrow invent this distinction&mdash;I assume not&mdash;but distinguishing &lsquo;formal&rsquo; freedoms from &lsquo;substantive&rsquo; freedoms is helpful. My sense is that the political left in the United States has largely ceded talk of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to the right; you don&rsquo;t often (or, at least, I don&rsquo;t often) encounter arguments for leftist politics on the basis of freedom. But in fact, I think, the left does want &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; for people and their proposals can help facilitate such freedom. The difference is the left is less concerned with formal freedom (the concern of the right) than it is with substantive freedom.</p>
<p>This is one piece of Graeber &amp; Wengrow&rsquo;s work that I really appreciate. They repeatedly stress that American indigenous peoples had a worldview closer to the contemporary US than European Enlightenment thinkers, because American indigenous peoples were concerned with (substantive) freedom. It&rsquo;s a clever rhetorical move: both the original inhabitants of the American continents and the present inhabitants of the American continents are interested in freedom; the difference is, in what that freedom consists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remain convinced that no one, logically speaking, could merit eternal punishment; but I also accept
the obverse claim that no one could merit grace. This does not mean, however, that grace must be rare in order to be truly gracious, as so many in the infernalist party so casually assume it must. Grace universally given is still grace. A gift made to everyone is no less a gift, and a gift that is intrinsically precious need not be rare to be an act of the highest generosity. Conversely, that gift becomes no more precious—indeed, it becomes much less so—if it is certified in its value by being distributed only parsimoniously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor does this mean calling for forgiveness when it involves renouncing our own rights, confronting corrupt officials, criminals or those who would debase our dignity. We are called to love everyone, without exception; at the same time, loving an oppressor does not mean allowing him to keep oppressing us, or letting him think that what he does is acceptable. On the contrary, true love for an oppressor means seeking ways to make him cease his oppression; it means stripping him of a power that he does not know how to use, and that diminishes his own humanity and that of others. Forgiveness does not entail allowing oppressors to keep trampling on their own dignity and that of others, or letting criminals continue their wrongdoing. Those who suffer injustice have to defend strenuously their own rights and those of their family, precisely because they must preserve the dignity they have received as a loving gift from God. If a criminal has harmed me or a loved one, no one can forbid me from demanding justice and ensuring that this person – or anyone else – will not harm me, or others, again. This is entirely just; forgiveness does not forbid it but actually demands it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freud said that mourning is a &ldquo;great riddle,&rdquo; and its greatness partially consists in its not being the kind of riddle that gets solved. Mourning, he says, is &ldquo;one of those phenomena which cannot themselves be explained but to which other obscurities can be traced back.&rdquo; In essence, mourning is one of the ways we exercise our capacity for love. We get attached to people and ideals, thoughts and projects that are themselves vulnerable. And we respond to that vulnerability by becoming active ourselves in making sense of what it all meant or will continue to mean. Other animals suffer loss; other animals grieve in complex ways. If we want, we can call that mourning. But our form of mourning is an attempt to turn loss into a reanimated gain&mdash;in imagination, thought, emotion and, importantly, symbolic expression. We make human meanings, and when we can share these meanings publicly it is constitutive of the formation of culture. Aristotle lived; Aristotle died: it is only our activity that transforms this change into loss and into a certain kind of gain.</p>

			 <p>B. D. McClay, <a href="https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/reality-and-its-alternatives/articles/tell-me-im-ok">contrasting Simone Weil and Simone de Beauvoir against Jordan Peterson and Todd May as moral guides</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading Beauvoir’s work alongside Weil’s can make it clear that freedom exists not only in what we do but in what we do not do. Rising to the challenge of our freedom does not mean living a life of hedonism or selfishness. It might mean living more like Weil—taking what you need, and giving away the surplus—with the caveat that one takes what one actually needs. With the acceptance of our moral freedom comes a widening of our moral imagination—that we do not have to relegate heroism to others or tell ourselves comforting stories to get through our lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, what mystifies me is the insistence on acting like <em>having to see or talk to</em> the homeless is <em>in itself</em> a social problem, not <em>because they’re homeless</em> but because <em>you had to see it</em>. I think I’m a pretty sinful person, but that feeling I simply don’t relate to. If the person is screaming at you or following you or physically attacking you, you’re within your rights to get mad, obviously, as you would at anyone who does those things, but if the person is simply standing there and asking you for a tenner, you say “I’m sorry, man, I don’t have it, but good luck” and you keep walking. To feel anger at that person (rather than at, say, the mayor, or the governor, or the President, or God, or yourself) just makes no sense to me, except as the expression of a deep, atavistic human instinct that tells us that misery is a contagious disease.</p>

			 <p>Agnes Callard, <a href="https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/why-am-i-being-hurt/">on Simone Weil&rsquo;s useful distinction between suffering and affliction</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of our frustrations with our children lie in the fact that they have not yet learned to find certain forms of—trivial, mundane—suffering to be intelligible. Young children do not seem to understand any suffering. Yet even after we exit childhood, we are guaranteed to encounter misfortunes that surpass our understanding. If Weil is right, the form that these experiences take is interrogative: the expression of affliction, because it is a request for understanding, comes in the form of a question.</p>

			 <p>Something that&rsquo;s long irritiated me is when people excuse their own rudeness or cruelty by claiming to be &ldquo;blunt&rdquo; or &ldquo;brutally honest.&rdquo; That may be, but more often than not, I find that such people actually just can&rsquo;t be bothered to put in the effort to be polite to other people by filtering out whatever happens to pop into their head. <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/cruelty-isnt-clarity">Phil Christman&rsquo;s comments</a> on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/style/marriage-heather-havrilesky-foreverland.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">that recent terrible NYT piece about hating one&rsquo;s spouse</a> offer further insight on a similar phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I run into this assumption all the time, that the meanest take or harshest thought you might have about someone else, the most reductive, one-datum-reflected-in-a-funhouse-mirror-so-it’s-all-you-see sort of vision, is held up as some truth that we’re normally too weak to face. A person who is casually cruel always defends themselves by saying “Well at least I’m honest.” Honesty about <em>what is running through your head right this second</em> isn’t the same as <em>honesty in the sense of actually making the effort to get other people and things right</em>. The second thing takes forever, which is one reason why a marriage does.</p>

<p>Frodo, of Gollum: It&rsquo;s a pity Bilbo didn&rsquo;t kill him when he had the chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo&rsquo;s hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked this line from Peter Jackson&rsquo;s adaptation of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>&mdash;very similar to the original in Tolkien&rsquo;s novel, but slightly more economical. I&rsquo;m not sure I would agree now that &ldquo;many that live deserve death&rdquo;&mdash;that seems overharsh&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not sure that the reason we should be slow to deal out death is because of a certain near-sightedness; as if someone with farther and keener vision might be so entitled to deal out death.</p>
<p>Indeed, I would probably want to switch the two quantities Gandalf uses here: perhaps it is the case that some that live deserve death; it is certainly the case that many that die deserve life. That alone&mdash;that a great many people are dealt death rather than life when they are born into poverty, when they are denied necessary medical care, when they are incarcerated at rates disproportionate to their crime, when they are killed by the state, when they are victims of violence, etc., etc.&mdash;that alone should give us pause before further perpetuating death. Death, once dealt, cannot be withdrawn; not by us.</p>
<p>I like, too, how Gandalf recommends pity as a sort of default disposition toward those we encounter; not pity in a patronizing or paternalistic sense, but rather pity as a fellow-feeling of compassion for the sufferings or distresses of others.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/">Phil Christman</a>, on why cops are cops:</p>

Though the function of police is purportedly &ldquo;to serve and protect,&rdquo; the reality of policing in the United States suggests a different motivation than service or protection (or, at least, it is not the whole of a community whom cops are serving and protecting): perhaps cops, even good cops, are cops because (as Christman elsewhere puts it) &ldquo;they actually kinda do like force as such.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Thomas Merton (in <em>Raids on the Unspeakable</em>) on the nativity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Into this world, this demented inn, in which there is absolutely no room for Him at all, Christ has come uninvited. But because He cannot be at home in it, because He is out of place in it, and yet He must be in it, His place is with those others for whom there is no room. His place is with those who do not belong, who are rejected by power because they are regarded as weak, those who are discredited, who are denied the status of persons, tortured, exterminated. With those for whom there is no room, Christ is present in this world. He is mysteriously present in those for whom there seems to be nothing but the world at its worst. For them, there is no escape even in imagination. They cannot identify with the power structure of a crowded humanity which seeks to project itself outward, anywhere, in a centrifugal flight into the void, to get <em>out there</em> where there is no God, no man, no name, no identity, no weight, no self, nothing but the bright, self-directed, perfectly obedient and infinitely expensive machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For those who are stubborn enough, devoted enough to power, there remains this last apocalyptic myth of machinery propagating its own kind in the eschatological wilderness of space&mdash;while on earth the bombs make room!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the others: they remain imprisoned in other hopes, and in more pedestrian despairs, despairs and hopes which are held down to earth, down to street level, and to the pavement only: desire to be at least half-human, to taste a little human joy, to do a fairly decent job of productive work, to come home to the family &hellip; desires for which there is no room. It is in these that He hides Himself, for whom there is no room.</p>

			 <p>From Alberto Manguel&rsquo;s <em>A History of Reading</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep down the production costs he [Aldus Manutius] decided to print a thousand copies at a time, and to use the page more economically he employed a newly designed type, &ldquo;italic&rdquo;, created by the Bolognese punch-cutter Francesco Griffo, who also cut the first roman type in which the capitals were shorter than the ascending (full-height) letters of the lower case to ensure a better-balanced line. The result was a book that appeared much plainer than the ornate manuscript editions popular throughout the Middle Ages, a volume of elegant sobriety. What counted above all, for the owner of an Aldine pocket-book, was the text, clearly and eruditely printed&mdash;not a preciously decorated object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m painting in very broad strokes here, but it seems to me something else at play (aside from economics and consumer preferences) is shifting aesthetics brought on by the protestant reformation.</p>
