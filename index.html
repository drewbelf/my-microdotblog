<p>We want stories; we say they illuminate; &amp; the truer the story, the better we like it. But no one knows how to tell true stories. And yet we&rsquo;re made of stories, we&rsquo;ve been captivated by them since childhood: &ldquo;Listen! Read! Look!‚Äù&mdash;our truth be done, may it draw us near &amp; send us far with pictures &amp; words.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed chess but apart from knowing the rules &amp; some basic opening &amp; endgame principles, I&rsquo;ve never really understood the game. So far this book feels pitched a little below my level&mdash;though I&rsquo;m still in the &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; chapters&mdash;but Rozman&rsquo;s explanations of the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind certain best practices in opening strategy is helpful.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/movies/saltburn-review.html">Wesley Morris&rsquo;s review of <em>Saltburn</em></a> is one of the harshest I&rsquo;ve read in the <em>New York Times</em>, which tends to publish (so far as I can remember) fairly mild reviews. Just look at that opening paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúSaltburn‚Äù is the sort of embarrassment you‚Äôll put up with for 75 minutes. But not for 127. It‚Äôs too desperate, too confused, too pleased with its petty shocks to rile anything you‚Äôd recognize as genuine excitement. This thing was written and directed by Emerald Fennell, whose previous movie was ‚ÄúPromising Young Woman,‚Äù a horror flick about rape that was also a revenge comedy. So believe me: She wants you riled. &hellip; The question here, amid all the lying, lazing about and (eventually, inevitably) dying, is to what end?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The review concludes: to no end, really. The review is harsh, but entirely fair&mdash;the movie was not good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The census of the whole earth, in a word, manifests the all-too-human thread that runs through history: the quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory, which measures everything in terms of success, results, numbers and figures, a world obsessed with achievement. Yet the census also manifests the way of Jesus, who comes to seek us through enfleshment. He is not the god of accomplishment, but the God of Incarnation. He does not eliminate injustice from above by a show of power, but from below, by a show of love. He does not burst on the scene with limitless power, but descends to the narrow confines of our lives. He does not shun our frailties, but makes them his own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would not, now, if I had Frank Capra‚Äôs ear &amp; a gasper &amp; martini in my hand &amp; the studio at my command, go back &amp; change the scene I once thought the only major blemish in a perfect movie. It is the climax of a great love story‚Äîbetween people with children &amp; not enough money &amp; frustrations &amp; shameful failures, as many great love stories are. It is a recognition of the unpredictable depths of a woman too easily rated as charming decoration in her own story. But more importantly, it is a pivot within the story Clarence is telling George. For all the extraordinary, irreplaceable good George has done for others, what makes his life finally wonderful‚Äîawe inspiring, mysterious‚Äîis what has been done for him. He never, after all, set out to win Mary Hatch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps Julian&rsquo;s central theological insight that sin wages war against love because sin is of its own nature violent, but love wages no wars at all, not even against sin, for love is absolute vulnerability. Love knows no other strategy than that vulnerability. For that reason, then, neither is any subsequent reversal of the Cross&rsquo;s violent defeat necessary, for it is precisely in that victory of sin over love that sin is defeated. In its victory over love sin defeats itself. Sin&rsquo;s failure to engage perfect love in a contest on sin&rsquo;s terms of violence &amp; power <em>is</em> sin&rsquo;s defeat, its power being exhausted by its very success. For killing is the best strategy that sin can come up with; it is sin&rsquo;s last resort. The Resurrection, then, is the meaning of the Cross, the meaning that the vulnerability of love, its refusal of the sword, is stronger than sin&rsquo;s power to kill. That is all we know. That is all we can know. The meaning of the Cross neither allows for a fairy-tale ending nor needs one.</p>

<p>Julian &hellip; systematically refuses to finish, because she intends theological incompleteness. And she intends theological incompleteness on grounds that are themselves theological, or at least meta-theological, that is to say, because she knows that what alone completes the theological is also what transcends its powers, namely, the beatific vision. The theologian, in short, is forced to raise more questions than she can answer, for the questions that perforce arise within the limits of theology of necessity can be answered for now only inaccessibly beyond it. Of theological necessity, then, is her &ldquo;boke not yet performed.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the servant is comprehended the second person of the Trinity, &amp; in the servant is comprehended Adam, that is to say, all humans. &amp; therefore when I say &lsquo;the Son&rsquo;, it means the Godhead, which is equal with the Father, &amp; when I say &lsquo;the servant&rsquo;, it means Christ&rsquo;s humanity, which is truly Adam. &hellip; The lord is the Father, God; the servant is the Son, Christ Jesus. The Holy Ghost is equal love which is in both of them. When Adam fell, God&rsquo;s son fell; because of the true union made in heaven, God&rsquo;s son could not leave Adam, for by Adam I understand all humans. Adam fell from life to death into the valley of this wretched world, &amp; after that into hell. God&rsquo;s son fell with Adam into the valley of the Virgin&rsquo;s womb (&amp; she was the fairest daughter of Adam), in order to free Adam from guilt in heaven &amp; in earth; &amp; with his great power he fetched him out of hell.</p>

Reading that chapter gave us a chance to talk about Merton&rsquo;s understanding of the true and false selves, which is how I presented spirituality to students: spirituality is the process of coming to know &amp; live one&rsquo;s true self. But besides giving us a working understanding of spirituality, that true self/false self framework has made for a surprising throughline across the course. Students (&amp; I) are constantly referring back to true self &amp; false self as we make sense of Francis &amp; Clare&rsquo;s lives &amp; spiritualities. It&rsquo;s made for some excellent in-class discussion!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>St. Anselm &amp; St. Bernard are the chief influences in our period in making intelligible the spiritual impulses of their contemporaries. But before leaving them, one name must be mentioned which represents the climax of the developments we have been discussing: the name of St. Francis. The period of his public career from 1209 to 1226 lies outside the scope of this book, but he is the embodiment of the spirit of Christian romance which we have watched in some aspects of its development from the time of St. Anselm. The inward quest of St. Anselm or St. Bernard&mdash;faith seeking understand, or carnal love seeking its spiritual object&mdash;was given an external symbolism in the homeless, wandering, unsheltered life of the beggar. The most negative &amp; drabbest of the monastic virtues&mdash;Poverty&mdash;was transformed Cinderella-like into a fairy princess, &amp; invested with the fascinating qualities of a romantic heroine. Above all, the tender, passionate love of Jesus had its earthly consummation in the vision of the Crucified &amp; the crisis of the stigmata on Monte Alverna in 1224. With St. Francis &amp; his followers, the fruits of the experiences of St. Anselm &amp; St. Bernard were brought to the market place, &amp; became the common property of the lay &amp; clerical world alike.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The asymmetry of the Logos&mdash;through whom all things were made&mdash;in relation to created being means that the act of incarnation overdetermines every finite becoming; the transformative reality of the Son resides for us wholly in the Incarnate fact of his being <em>ex Maria</em>. What the Son receives <em>ex Maria</em> does not change the eternal Son; rather it unleashes the transformative power of his divine being into our human world. This is more or less what <a href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/summa/TP/TP002.html#TPQ2A7THEP1">the mixed relation ensures in Thomas</a>: the whole becoming, the whole drama of the eternal &ldquo;is&rdquo; of the Logos resides in the life of Jesus, thus foreclosing (1) every simple transition from the Incarnate Son to the (as if temporally &ldquo;before‚Äù) pre-Incarnate Son, while ensuring that (2) it is precisely our human reality that is changed by his divine act.</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Incarnation remains a mystery. But, perhaps, Aquinas can help us to see that we don&rsquo;t therefore have to talk nonsense about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would add (&amp; I&rsquo;m certain McCabe would agree) that this goes for not only Aquinas but for any good theology. Indeed, that&rsquo;s not a bad way to put the task of theology: learning how not to speak nonsense about mystery.</p>

			 <p>With the start of the fall semester next Monday, I&rsquo;ve already had multiple nightmares about the first day of class. In one, I forgot to print my course syllabi, so I was 20 minutes late to class waiting for them to print; in another, I ate a Tootsie roll that I could not chew &amp; swallow, so I had a wad of Tootsie roll in my mouth the entire class; in a third, the class was so unruly I couldn&rsquo;t even complete calling the roll.

<p>It is of the greatest consequence to see that negative language about God is no more apophatic in itself than is affirmative language. The apophatic is the linguistic strategy of somehow showing by means of language that which lies beyond language. It is not done, and it cannot be done, by means of negative utterances alone which are no less bits of ordinarily intelligible human discourse than are affirmations. Our negations, therefore, fail of God as much as do our affirmations.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781952826245">√âtienne Gilson</a> on Bonaventure&rsquo;s understanding of the unity of divine ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the ideas designate divine expressions, not in relation to God Himself, but in relation to things; so a certain multiplicity is introduced not into what they are, or even into what they signify, but into what they connote. It is as though the multiplicity of material things produced by the divine ideas cast a sort of diversifying reflection upon their unity, with the result that we believe by a quite natural illusion that we find already formed in them a plurality which cannot really exist since it implies the presence of matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this articulation of a primordial unity to what is, prior to (yet without denying the reality of) multiplicity in matter.</p>

			 <p>James Baldwin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a sense of the grotesque about a person who has spent his or her life in a kind of cotton batting. There is something monstrous about never having been hurt, never having been made to bleed, never having lost anything, never having gained anything because life is beautiful, and in order to keep it beautiful you&rsquo;re going to stay just the way you are and you&rsquo;re not going to test your theory against all the possibilities outside. America is something like that. The failure on our part to accept the reality of pain, of anguish, of ambiguity, of death has turned us into a very peculiar and sometimes monstrous people. It means, for one thing, and it&rsquo;s very serious, that people who have had no experience have no compassion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This connection between the experience of pain &amp; the possibility of compassion is instructive, I think, especially in how <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781506471730">Anne Carpenter</a> then applies it to Christian tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recognition of a Christian tradition that is capable of immense ugliness&mdash;the recovery of our life&rsquo;s pain, of the pain we have inflicted on others&mdash;is, then, requisite for the rediscovery of Christian compassion, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P%C3%A9guy">P√©guy</a> simply calls &ldquo;charity.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why have we settled for this strange cultural compromise&mdash;lowbrow genres, done with middlebrow earnestness, in pretend revolt against a thoroughly defunded highbrow regime? The answer is simple &amp; depressing. We have accepted the idea of the democratization of culture&mdash;we have accepted, rightly, that, say, opera is not inherently worthier than jazz, that superhero comics are not inherently dumb, that ancient epic poetry is not automatically loftier than rap (with which it shares some features), that all of these things can be done well or badly &amp; that they serve different ends&mdash;without accomplishing <em>democracy</em>. I mean this in a dully straightforward way. We are not all equally in control of our lives, &amp; we are afraid of what becoming so would entail, of the costs of democracy, of the mess of it. We are divided by class, race, &amp; gender &amp; united only in being the objects of a ceaseless corporate effort to accomplish our commodification. Having lost the economic battle to economic &amp; political elites, we celebrate, again &amp; again, our victory over the mostly imaginary cultural elite that would scorn us for watching <em>90 Day Fianc√©</em>. What you can&rsquo;t do practically, you do symbolically, until it becomes a neurosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can say that the mediatory action that tradition &ldquo;is&rdquo;&mdash;the <em>tradere</em> of <em>traditio</em>&mdash;is most properly understood &amp; most properly &ldquo;itself&rdquo; in the present, in the <em>action</em> of Christian existence (in thought, in practice). Tradition, we might say, is alive in the living. Though it is at times characterized as the memory of the dead, its life is to be found in the thinking &amp; practicing of living Christians, a notion that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Blondel">Blondel</a> also stresses. Tradition&rsquo;s value, &amp; what is to be valued in it, is not to be found in its <em>pastness</em>. Its value is what it mediates, is its mediation.</p>
<p>&amp; this mediation of tradition is not unhinged from its past. This is not in other words, the expression of a tyranny of pure contemporaneity. Today is permeable to yesterday, indeed enlivened by yesterday, through human action (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P%C3%A9guy">the poem-plays</a>: the action of prayer). But yesterday only lives on in a specific act of remembering, one where the aliveness of the original is reiterated by being begun again, a beginning-again that infuses the original with new richness.</p>

<p>The staggering thing that this means, for me, is that the most extraordinary fruit of contemplation in the shadow of the violence which we are experiencing is this: God likes us. All of us. God likes me &amp; I like being liked. It has nothing to do with whether we are bad or good, indeed, he takes it for granted that we are all more or less strongly tied up in the sacred lie. In teaching after teaching he makes the same point: all are invited, bad &amp; good. Those are our categories, part of the problem not part of the solution, not God&rsquo;s category. God&rsquo;s &lsquo;category&rsquo; for us is &lsquo;created&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;created&rsquo; means &lsquo;liked spaciously, delighted in, wanted to give extension, fulfilment, fruition to, to share in just being&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This willingness continually to revise one&rsquo;s own location in order to place oneself in the path of beauty is the basic impulse underlying education. One submits oneself to other minds (teachers) in order to increase the chance that one will be looking in the right direction when a comet makes its sweep through a certain patch of sky. The arts and sciences, like Plato&rsquo;s dialogues, have at their center the drive to confer greater clarity on what already has clear discernibility, as well as to confer initial clarity on what originally has none. They are a key mechanism in what Diotima called begetting and what Tocqueville called distribution. By perpetuating beauty, institutions of education help incite the will toward continual creation.</p>

<p>Composing for movies, often mischaracterized as auxiliary to the primary work of filmmaking, is an art form in its own right. At its best, it stands equally with not just the feats of directing and cinematography but also the greatest classical compositions.</p>

			 <p>Gilson on Bonaventure&rsquo;s translation of Francis&rsquo;s <em>ascesis</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imitation of St. Francis could not be literal imitation as he had to omit the extraordinary asceticism and the extreme macerations practised by him: it had to be rather a translation. And this translation itself was possible only provided that some other discipline should come to fill the place left void, and play the part played in the earlier saint by discipline of the body. And, extraordinary as the thing must then have seemed, why should this new discipline not have been a discipline of the mind? Prayer, of course, meditation, already so wonderfully practised by St. Francis; but why not also a new transmutation of learning into love, a transmutation unknown to the founder of the Order because the ways of learning had not been his?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What St. Francis had simply felt and lived, St. Bonaventure was to <em>think</em>; thanks to the organizing power of his genius, the interior effusions of the Poverello were to be given shape as thought; the personal intuitions of St. Francis were totally detached from science, but they were to work like leaven in the mass of philosophical ideas piled up by Bonaventure in the University of Paris, to act as a principle of selection, eliminating some elements, assimilating others, drawing nourishment from Aristotle as from St. Augustine, yet adapting both to its use wherever it judged necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all the guilt-tripping and scapegoating implicit in the late medieval obsession with human responsibility for the death of Christ, there are optimistic and universalist implications in the understanding that that death is representative. If it is <em>humanitas</em> that suffers, if <em>pars</em> is really <em>totum</em>, then <em>all</em> are in the suffering body lifted to God and <em>all</em> are in every self that joins with, that performs, the <em>humanitas</em> of Christ.</p>

			 <p>Zena Hitz on <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/the-grace-of-wholeheartedness">reununciation &amp; happiness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feared that if I were not in charge of my happiness, I would not attain it. Such fears were fed by my relative wealth and success. Wealth is dangerous: it provides the illusion of dominance over one‚Äôs surroundings. If I can replace something in my household if I simply don‚Äôt like its looks, if I can order a car and driver whenever my feet are tired, or fly to Rome whenever I crave pasta carbonara, or purchase a warm blanket at the first chill of winter, I develop illusions about myself. Even worse, if I can transform a landscape with my enterprise, whether by building or by destruction, if I have the power of life or death over others, I begin to imagine that I am a sort of being different from what I really am. I begin to imagine myself as a godlike being who makes reality when I open my mouth or raise a single finger. Yet ultimately my control is extremely limited, as Oedipus learned, by the luck of circumstances and by inescapable forms of human ignorance. Wealth can seem to make these contingencies shrink, but they cannot be eliminated. Dependence and blindness are core realities for every human being.</p>

<p>Let me draw upon the register of contemporary philosophy to explain: if Heidegger is correct that the key to a thinker&rsquo;s ideas lies in &ldquo;that which, in what is said, remains unsaid&rdquo; (<em>das im Sagen Ungesagte</em>)&mdash;in unarticulated, sometimes even unthought presuppositions underpinning an entire intellectual edifice&mdash;then it may not only be legitimate but crucial to read a work from its margins, from between its lines.</p>

I wish I had read it instead of listening to the audiobook. The audiobook narrator read in a very performative style, almost like it was a stage production, at times even shouting the words. That approach may have suited Yuknavitch&rsquo;s writing style, but I found it consistently distracting and occasionally even irritating.</p>

			 <p>Dorothy Day <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/scandal-works-mercy">on the scandalous character of the works of mercy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The works of mercy are a wonderful stimulus to our growth in faith as well as in love. Our faith is taxed to the utmost and so grows through this strain put upon it. It is pruned again and again, and springs up bearing much fruit. For anyone starting to live literally the words of the Fathers of the Church, ‚Äúthe bread you retain belongs to the hungry, the dress you lock up is the property of the naked,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat is superfluous for one‚Äôs need is to be regarded as plunder if one retains it for one‚Äôs self,‚Äù there is always a trial ahead. ‚ÄúOur faith, more precious than gold, must be tried as though by fire.‚Äù Here is a letter we received today. ‚ÄúI took a gentleman seemingly in need of spiritual and temporal guidance into my home on a Sunday afternoon. Let him have a nap on my bed, went through the want ads with him, made coffee and sandwiches for him, and when he left, I found my wallet had gone also.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her words call to mind, for me, the words attributed to St. Vincent de Paul (I have not been able to verify whether they are indeed his):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will find out that Charity is a heavy burden to carry, heavier than the kettle of soup and the full basket. But you will keep your gentleness and your smile. It is not enough to give soup and bread. This the rich can do. You are the servant of the poor, always smiling and good-humored. They are your masters, terribly sensitive and exacting master you will see and the uglier and the dirtier they will be, the more unjust and insulting, the more love you must give them. It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.</p>

			 <p>I love this move Pope Francis makes in his interpretation of the parable of the good Samaritan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus asks us to be present to those in need of help, regardless of whether or not they belong to our social group. In this case, the Samaritan¬†<em>became a neighbour</em>¬†to the wounded Judean. By approaching and making himself present, he crossed all cultural and historical barriers. Jesus concludes the parable by saying: ‚ÄúGo and do likewise‚Äù (<em>Lk</em>¬†10:37). In other words, he challenges us to put aside all differences and, in the face of suffering, to draw near to others with no questions asked. I should no longer say that I have neighbours to help, but that I must myself be a neighbour to others.

			 <p>Interesting series on apophatic &amp; cataphatic theology over at Theopolis. <a href="https://theopolisinstitute.com/conversations/the-eclipse-of-the-word-five-theses-on-apophaticism/">Timothy Troutner suggests</a> a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; apophaticism (represented especially in so-called grammatical thomists like McCabe &amp; in post-Heidegerrean philosophers like Marion) endangers the possibility of revelation &amp; christology. I find myself more sympathetic to <a href="https://theopolisinstitute.com/conversations/fear-desire-and-perplexity">Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt&rsquo;s response</a> (not exactly a disagreement with Troutner, though certainly a defense of McCabe&rsquo;s grammatical thomism), but I&rsquo;ll have to think more carefully about Troutner&rsquo;s concerns, especially since I myself am inclined to the sort of apophaticism grammatical thomism represents.</p>

			 <p>Walter Kasper on theodicy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the terrible experiences of the twentieth century the question arises unavoidably: How can God stand by and watch all this? How could he allow it? There is no easy answer to this question. Like Job we can only keep silence (cf. Job 42). The christology of the Church Fathers shows the direction in which to look for a possible answer. It starts from the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Philippians. There Paul speaks of <em>kenosis</em>, that is, the self-emptying of one who was in the form of God (Phil. 2.5&ndash;11). On the basis of this saying, the Church Fathers developed their <em>kenosis</em> christology. It says: God did not just stand by and watch human misery. He does not sit motionlessly enthroned over a world full of horror. He himself also became involved in humiliation, suffering and death, even unjust death, in order to be near us in such extreme situations, so that where all hope is lost he can give us hope and a share in his divine life.</p>

			 <p>B. D. McClay, <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/you-cant-earn-easter">on the cost of cheap grace</a>:</p>

<p>In Catherine of Siena‚Äôs <em>Dialogue</em>, God says that ‚Äúguilt is not atoned for by suffering simply as suffering,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúthe value is not in the suffering but in the soul‚Äôs desire.‚Äù His love isn‚Äôt merited through suffering, but simply present for us, whether or not we ask for it and whether or not we deserve it. Grace is equally cheap and equally costly to anybody willing to accept it. And Easter promises us that something has <em>actually happened</em>, that our faith doesn‚Äôt simply depend on a conveniently unrealized future.</p>

<p>But this is a grim and narrow view of the purpose of higher education, merely as a tool to train workers as replaceable cogs in America‚Äôs economic machine, to generate raw material for its largest companies. Higher education, with broad study in the liberal arts, is meant to create not merely good workers but good citizens. Citizens with knowledge of their history and culture are better equipped to lead and participate in a democratic society; learning in many different forms of knowledge teaches the humility necessary to accept other points of view in a pluralistic and increasingly globalized society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What a sorry lot are those Christians who think that their religion is a museum of memories; their only desire is to preserve the memories and not expose themselves to danger. No, sisters and brothers, the church is communion and life; she is communion of life, and her members must confront life in real time. That is life. The church&rsquo;s laws, dogmas, and beliefs must be transformed into life. Those who don&rsquo;t want to understand the church this way are not worshiping the eternal living One, Christ, who will never die. We worship a living God who walks alongside the people, the God who tells us not to commit injustices because if the poor victims of usurers and loan sharks &ldquo;cry out to heaven, I will hear them, for I am the living God&rdquo; (Exod. 22:27).</p>

			 <p>Yesterday <a href="https://readingreligion.org/9780823298006/the-body-of-the-cross/">my review of Travis Ables&rsquo;s <em>The Body of the Cross: Holy Victims and the Invention of the Atonement</em></a> posted to <em>Reading Religion</em>. A remarkable achievement in historical theology, Ables&rsquo;s careful historical work has clear &amp; important implications for today. It was a pleasure to read &amp; review.</p>

<p>One day the earth will belong to all people<br>
and the people will be free<br>
as you, God, have willed it<br>
from the very beginning.</p>
<p>This song speaks <em>to</em> God, not <em>about</em> God. It liberates us from the idol of fate in whose power everything happens simply as it happens. It binds us together with a God who is not the all-powerful conqueror but stands instead on the side of the poor and disadvantaged&mdash;a God who is always hidden in the world and wants to become visible.</p>

			 <p>I think Everything Everywhere All At Once will win <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2023">best picture</a> tonight (though I confess I haven&rsquo;t seen Elvis; Top Gun: Maverick; All Quiet on the Western Front; or Women Talking).

I thought the Daniels were a little too satisfied with themselves (&amp; it showed), &amp; I&rsquo;m not sure the movie deals with the existential dread of the multiverse as well as it thinks it does.</p>
<p>Of the best picture nominees I&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;d most like to see The Banshees of Inisherin win. It was weird; it was moving; it had a few amazing performances; &amp;, though dark, it didn&rsquo;t seem nearly as pessimistic as did EEAAO. üìΩÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>Noam Chomsky on the inherent limitations of ChatGPT and other forms of artificial &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, ChatGPT and its brethren are constitutionally unable to balance creativity with constraint. They either overgenerate (producing both truths and falsehoods, endorsing ethical and unethical decisions alike) or undergenerate (exhibiting noncommitment to any decisions and indifference to consequences). Given the amorality, faux science and linguistic incompetence of these systems, we can only laugh or cry at their popularity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Love! Love!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not war, not force! Even prayer, Brother Bernard, is not enough; good works are needed too. It is difficult and dangerous to live among men, but necessary. To withdraw into the wilderness and pray is too easy, too convenient. Prayer is slow in producing its miracles; works are faster, surer, more difficult. Wherever you find men, you will also find suffering, illness, and sin. That is where our place is, my brother: with lepers, sinners, with those who are starving. Deep down in the bowels of every man, even the saintliest ascetic, there sleeps a horrible, unclean larva. Lean over and say to this larva: ‚ÄòI love you!‚Äô and it shall sprout wings and become a butterfly. &hellip; Love, I bow and worship thine omnipotence. Come and kiss our friars; come and accomplish thy miracle!&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So Rome is always dying (partially) from head down, while being (in part) resurrected from feet up. New forms of life have come from unexpected places&mdash;from Athanasius at local councils, Benedict in the monasteries, Albertus and Thomas in the universities, Francis of Assisi in the lanes and roads, Ignatius alone with a penitent making <em>The Spiritual Exercises</em>, Xavier and Ricci out at the rim of the world, Acton and Newman in pamphlets and journals.</p>
<p>These stirrings of life are not normally inspired, or even approved, by officials. Their leaders were held suspect, their teachings suppressed. Reformers could count themselves lucky if they were only silenced (like Abelard and Newman), condemned (like Erasmus and Wyclif), exiled by church authorities (like Athanasius and Chrysostom), or jailed by them (like St. John of the Cross and St. Ignatius of Loyola)&mdash;after all, St. Joan and Savonarola and John Hus were tortured and killed by them. But it has always been the task of the prophetic church, despite officials opposed to its opposition, to redeem the kingly church. Peter needs Paul&mdash;as Pope Innocent needed St. Francis, Pope Urban needed St. Catherine, or Pope Paul III needed Ignatius. As Paul VI needs Dan Berrigan. The Christian message is not authenticated from a throne.</p>

<p>What if we refused to make the suffering of Christ or Mary part of an algorithm and instead let their suffering stand? A community of memory and solidarity would refuse to rationalize the deaths of the unjustly murdered and instead commemorate their bodies, like <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781626980389?title=Sisters+in+the+Wilderness&amp;author=Dolores+S.+Williams&amp;cover_id=61623">Delores Williams</a>&rsquo;s desecration, as the victims of the blessed brutality of empire.

<blockquote>
<p>I didn‚Äôt buy a tool to defend myself because I knew it would make me afraid‚Äînot that it would <em>admit</em> fear, but that it would transform the world around me into a world of potential threats. And while in fact I‚Äôve had my share of low-level ugly encounters walking around my neighborhood‚Äîfrom nasty comments to someone blocking my way across the street with his car‚ÄîI never wished that I had a can of wasp spray sitting in my pocket. If I had to say what I wished, it would be for the people who made it their business to intimidate me to see me as a person, too.</p>
<p>But if I had come to meet them armed, I would not have seen them as people either. They would have been unreal targets of potential violence‚Äî<em>mine</em>. And all I really know is that price is too high to pay.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve long wanted to write of mercy and justice in <em>Les Mis√©rables</em>: what distinguishes Valjean and Javert, ultimately, is their different responses to an unmerited gift of mercy. <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/literature/victor-hugos-masterpiece-of-impossibility">Here&rsquo;s Caitrin Keiper for <em>Plough</em></a> on the seemingly impossibility of grace in <em>Les Mis</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main impossibility in the ideal of <em>Les Mis√©rables</em> is not that suffering will disappear, but that it can be redeemed; that brokenness does not erase the hope in any person; that dormant souls come back to life; that the cycle of retribution breaks for grace. And for symbolic confirmation of this impossible reality, there is an intimation of the stars on earth¬†‚Äì that is, candles.</p>

<p>To overcome careerism and knowingness [the urge to present yourself as always already informed] and instill in students a desire to learn, schools and parents need to convince students (and perhaps themselves) that college has more to offer than job training. You‚Äôre a worker for only part of your life; you‚Äôre a human being, a creature with a powerful brain, throughout it.</p>

			 <p>Some Clare of Assisi for the Christmas season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, after all who ensnare their blind lovers<br>
in a deceitful and turbulent world<br>
have been completely passed over,<br>
may you totally love Him<br>
Who gave Himself totally for your love,<br>
At Whose beauty the sun and the moon marvel,<br>
Whose rewards and their uniqueness and grandeur have no limits;<br>
I am speaking of Him,<br>
the Son of the Most High,<br>
Whom the Virgin brought to birth<br>
and remained a virgin after His birth.</p>
<p>May you cling to His most sweet mother who gave birth to a Son Whom the heavens could not contain, and yet she carried Him in the little cloister of her holy womb and held Him on her virginal lap.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are called to be a Church that worships a Jesus who is poor and that serves him in the poor. As a saintly bishop once said: ‚ÄúThe Church supports and blesses efforts to change the structures of injustice, and sets down but one condition: that social, economic and political change truly benefit the poor‚Äù (St. √ìscar Romero). Certainly, it is not easy to leave the comfortable warmth of worldliness to embrace the stark beauty of the grotto of Bethlehem, but let us remember that <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/pope-francis-it-not-truly-christmas-without-poor">it is not truly Christmas without the poor</a>. Without the poor, we can celebrate Christmas, but not the birth of Jesus. Dear brothers, dear sisters, at Christmas God is poor: let charity be reborn!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It does seem that Jesus dealt with every act of forgiveness as one who was convinced that there is in every act of injury an element that is irresponsible and irrational. No evil deed&mdash;and no good deed, either&mdash;was named by him as an expression of the total mind of the doer. Once, when someone addressed him as &ldquo;Good Master,&rdquo; Jesus is quoted as having said, &ldquo;Why callest thou me good? there is none good, but&hellip;God.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Thomas Merton on the goodness of humans &amp; original sin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hate others because we cannot stand the disorder, the intolerable division in ourselves. We are violent to others because we are already divided by the inner violence of our infidelity to our own truth. Hatred projects this division outside ourselves into society. This is not far from the traditional doctrine of the Fathers of the Church concerning original sin! Note of course that the doctrine of original sin, properly understood, is <em>optimistic</em>. It does not teach that man is by nature evil, but that evil in him is unnatural, a disorder, a sin. If evil, lying, and hatred were natural to man, all men would be perfectly at home, perfectly happy in evil. Perhaps a few seem to find contentment in an unnatural state of falsity, hatred, and greed. They are not happy. Or if they are, they are unnatural.</p>

			 <p>Thomas Merton on Christmas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Into this world, this demented inn, in which there is absolutely no room for him at all, Christ comes uninvited. But because he cannot be at home in it, because he is out of place in it, and yet he must be in it, his place is with those others for whom there is no room. His place is with those who do not belong, who are rejected by power because they are regarded as weak, those who are discredited, who are denied the status of persons, tortured, exterminated. With those for whom there is no room, Christ is present in this world. He is mysteriously present in those for whom there seems to be nothing but the world at its worst.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She [Lilith] stood rigid. Mara buried her head in her hands. I gazed on the face of one who knew existence but not love‚Å†‚Äîknew nor life, nor joy, nor good; with my eyes I saw the face of a live death! She knew life only to know that it was dead, and that, in her, death lived. It was not merely that life had ceased in her, but that she was consciously a dead thing. She had killed her life, and was dead‚Å†‚Äîand knew it. She must <em>death it</em> forever and ever! She had tried her hardest to unmake herself, and could not! she was a dead life! she could not cease! she must <em>be</em>! In her face I saw and read beyond its misery‚Å†‚Äîsaw in its dismay that the dismay behind it was more than it could manifest. It sent out a livid gloom; the light that was in her was darkness, and after its kind it shone. She was what God could not have created. She had usurped beyond her share in self-creation, and her part had undone His! She saw now what she had made, and behold, it was not good! She was as a conscious corpse, whose coffin would never come to pieces, never set her free! Her bodily eyes stood wide open, as if gazing into the heart of horror essential‚Å†‚Äîher own indestructible evil. Her right hand also was now clenched‚Å†‚Äîupon existent Nothing‚Å†‚Äîher inheritance!</p>
<p>But with God all things are possible: He can save even the rich!</p>

			 <p>The last of <a href="https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/seven-theses-on-catholic-theology/">Anne Carpenter&rsquo;s seven theses on Catholic theology</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no either/or: God or history, the Incarnation or people of color, the Trinity or the oppressed, all that is divine and all that is just. Catholics need not stop short. We need not refuse the divine meaning surging through history in the forgotten of history. We need not say that it is enough, somehow, to have a diverse humanities, to study diverse sciences, and not to ask what this ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù means to God. Our refusal to draw back from the height residing in the depths would be a radical transfiguration of Catholic theology, and also its coming back to itself.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seriously considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/opinion/college-oral-exam.html?smid=url-share">making the final assessment in my classes an oral exam</a>, but I&rsquo;ve always decided against it for a number of reasons. My primary concern was the time commitment&mdash;with 100 undergraduate students across 4 sections, I thought it would just be too time-consuming. But I think this article is probably right that if I can more or less grade the exam on the spot it wouldn&rsquo;t take any longer than grading a written exam.</p>

			 <p>I love Indiana Jones&mdash;<em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> is my absolute favorite movie&mdash;but I&rsquo;m afraid <a href="https://youtu.be/y170QEOgYZ4">this trailer for the new Indiana Jones movie</a> doesn&rsquo;t do much for me. Indy&rsquo;s voiceover elicits nothing from me other than a slight cringe, and (judging from the shots in the trailer, anyway) it looks much too slick. What makes Indiana Jones Indiana Jones is the grit and texture. Without that, it&rsquo;s just another action-adventure movie. I&rsquo;ll see it and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be entertained, but I don&rsquo;t have high hopes. üìΩÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>I know less about Albert Schweitzer than I probably should, but what a way to end a book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He comes to us as One unknown, without a name, as of old, by the lake-side, He came to those men who knew him not. He speaks to us the same word: &lsquo;Follow thou me&rsquo; and sets us to the task which He has to fulfill for our time. He commands. And to those who obey Him, whether they be wise or simple, He will reveal Himself in the toils, the conflicts, the sufferings which they shall pass through in His fellowship, and as an ineffable mystery, they shall learn in their own experience Who He is.</p>

			 <p>Cyril of Alexandria, in <em>Quod sit unum</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that they [those who subscribe to a Nestorian christology] have turned the mystery of the economy in the flesh completely on its head, for in their argument one cannot see how God the Word, born of God, and God by nature, abased himself to a self-emptying and humbled himself to assume the form of a slave. On the contrary, in their estimate a man is exalted into the glory of the Godhead and into preeminence over all things; he receives the form of God and is raised on high and comes to be enthroned alongside the Father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all the times I&rsquo;ve read this text, I&rsquo;d never really tracked this particular movement in the argument. Nestorian christology tries to protect God from the humiliation of finite flesh in the incarnation, instead emphasizing the exaltation of an assumed man. But for Cyril, the humility is the whole point; it is only by that humility according to which the Word empties himself that humans have any hope of the exaltation that Nestorius seeks.</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe on the Trinity (from &ldquo;A Sermon for Pentecost&rdquo; in <em>God Still Matters</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God understands, contemplates, his divine life. We can think of God as forming a concept of himself (we don&rsquo;t have to, but we can); we can think of God&rsquo;s understanding as God&rsquo;s conceiving what it is to be God ‚Äì having an idea of the meaning of being God; God naming himself &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; We can think, as John may have done, of the concept or Word of God that was in the beginning with God, and was God; &lsquo;was God&rsquo; because it was the perfect, utterly adequate thought of God, no different from God. So the revelation of the Word made flesh is God&rsquo;s own idea of himself dwelling amongst us, God&rsquo;s word to himself becoming his word to us.</p>
<p>And then we can think (we don&rsquo;t have to but we can) of the joy that God takes in contemplating his life, his divinity, in the Word ‚Äì that profound acquiescence in being divine: the immense joy of the eternal God, not now in what he has created or done, but in what he is just in living, in being God. God knows his life and, in knowing it, loves it. Or: in eternity, the Father, contemplating his divine life, brings forth the Word, and through the Word gives forth Joy, the Spirit. So, as a reflection of this eternal life, in history, the father sends to us the Word made flesh, Jesus, and through the Word made flesh, gives forth to us the Joy of the Spirit, to make the Church. What happens in the story of Jesus is the image, the sign, the sacrament of the divine life in eternity. This is the tremendous mystery that the first disciples experienced (seemed almost to experience in their bodies) at Pentecost, the expression of the immense joy of God.</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe on original sin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To believe that Jesus is of God is to believe that, in rejecting him, people are making the most ultimate kind of rejection, the final contradiction of themselves. The crucifixion is not just one more case of a particular society showing its inhumanity. It is the whole human race showing its rejection of itself. The resurrection is the Father&rsquo;s refusal to accept this self-rejection of man.</p>

<p>Tolkien is utterly consistent with this morality, even at the expense of his most cherished characters: Frodo has no other choice than to use the power of the Ring to dominate Gollum, but he still pays for that immoral act when he is unable to complete his quest or to enjoy his life afterward. Can a company as intent upon domination as Amazon really understand this perspective ‚Äî and adapt that morality to the screen?</p>

			 <p>Herbert McCabe, on God&rsquo;s name:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;God&rsquo;, &lsquo;Theos&rsquo;, &lsquo;Deus&rsquo; is of course a name borrowed from paganism; we take it out of its proper context, where it is used for talking about the gods, and use it for our own purposes. This is quite a legitimate piece of borrowing and quite safe so long as it does not mislead us into thinking that the God we worship (or don&rsquo;t) is a god. We always do have to speak of our God with borrowed words; it is one of the special things about our God that there are no peculiarly appropriate words that belong to him, as with the language of carpentry or computer-speak. He is always dressed verbally in second-hand clothes that don&rsquo;t fit him very well. We always have to be on our guard against taking these clothes as revealing who and what he is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I generally like this paragraph, though I wonder if there at least three words that are not borrowed and so can be used properly of God, precisely because God has revealed Godself as: Father, Son, Holy Spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Austin had never heard any whimsy coming out of Julien&rsquo;s mouth before, but now it never stopped. Julien decided that he would raise Ajax to be the next pope. He was constantly on the lookout for pious deeds and minor miracles, which would confirm his calling. Julien started calling him Pius VII, which in French was pronounced &ldquo;<em>Pissette</em>&rdquo; and also meant &ldquo;little pisser.&rdquo; The whole idea was mad and in the worst taste, but Julien clung to it so long that Austin suspected he took it half-seriously.</p>

			 <p>A nice piece by Phil Christman on <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/developing-your-voice?utm_medium=reader2">finding one&rsquo;s voice</a>. His chief counsel is patience. It takes time to develop a voice, and one&rsquo;s voice emerges from imitation and modification of other&rsquo;s voices. Finding your voice also involves figuring out what&rsquo;s so central to who you are that you can&rsquo;t bear it being said anything less than perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever your deal is, whatever you think is true, whatever is so beautifully right to you that it gets you out of bed in the morning (and if it‚Äôs just the scream of your baby that gets you out of bed, that‚Äôs still a worldview, because somewhere behind all your exhaustion you believe that that baby is worth raising, you believe it unquestioningly, and if you didn‚Äôt you‚Äôd quit and fail like lots of parents do)‚Äîit‚Äôs all been said before, but it‚Äôs been said <em>a little bit wrong</em>, because it‚Äôs been said by humans. So you dig into your experience and find the examples, the details, the concessions, the stories that will proclaim the thing the way <em>you</em> want it proclaimed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you can do this, you&rsquo;ve got a voice. üí¨</p>

			 <p>Some pictures of St. Bonaventure University taken with <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2022/04/15/a-recent-ebay.html">my Pentax K1000</a> on (I think) Fujicolor 200. I&rsquo;m not entirely satisfied with these pictures; the color is a little underwhelming to me, which may be a consequence of either the film itself or the UV filter I&rsquo;ve used. The color of the sky is especially drab; it should be more blue than gray!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/studentpages/buildings/Friedsam%20Memorial%20Library.htm">Friedsam Memorial Library</a>, where I spend about <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours">3 to 4 hours each weekday</a> reading and researching for my book project. (The other hours of the workday are spent collating notes, tracking down citations, planning the research, etc.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The story I&rsquo;d heard told about St. Joseph&rsquo;s Oratory is this: when construction on the dining hall was completed, the University used the leftover bricks to build this oratory for the sisters working in the dining hall so they would have a place for quiet and prayer between meals. (I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true now, given that <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/studentpages/buildings/Devereux.htm">this webpage</a> reports the oratory as a gift from an Olean resident.) When I was a student here it was mostly empty, though in the years after I graduated one of the friars turned it into a chapel for perpetual eucharistic adoration. I don&rsquo;t think it serves that role any longer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The courtyard of <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/studentpages/buildings/Devereux.htm">Devereux Hall</a>, the oldest building (I think) on campus. Thomas Merton lived here (though on the other side of the building) when he taught at St. Bonaventure just before joining the Trappists. I love how the building almost entirely consumed with ivy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A detail of the ivy that hangs from Devereux Hall. This is, I think, my favorite of the set; the colors here (especially the green of the ivy) are more vibrant, and the light dances off the ivy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The main quad.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finally, the bell tower and <a href="http://archives.sbu.edu/chapel/index.htm">university chapel</a>. The bells are missing (I think they were taken down for some repair).</p>

			 <p>I like this characterization of prayer, in the fourth book of the Franciscan <em>Summa halensis</em> (q.26, m.3, a.7; p. 720 in the 1622 Cologne edition). A quick and rough translation (verging on paraphrase, really):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Properly speaking, prayer is the ascent of the soul to God ordered to the tasting or releasing of something; commonly speaking, prayer is any act of contemplation related to God; most commonly speaking, prayer is any good act.</p>

(I am less negative on the prequels than is Ganz, though likely for reasons relating to childhood nostalgia; there are also some rare exceptions, like <em>The Last Jedi</em> and especially <em>Rogue One</em>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three was enough to provide just enough content, but to allow for the imagination of the viewer space to begin its own play. Now, there‚Äôs just too much of everything. Once Star Wars represented limitless possibility of imagination; now it‚Äôs just another boring action series, of which there are already one million. Here, as with all cultural products, we‚Äôre approaching a general glut of the human spirit, caused by the overproduction of boring crap.</p>

			 <p>Willie James Jennings, with a really lovely description of theological education at the end of his <em>After Whiteness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be involved in theological education is to long for eternity and the end of death. It is to seek the blessed state where our words start to do new work by first joining the chorus of the words of those who live forever in the Lord and who sound the healing and redeeming voice of the living God. Then our words will heal. Then our words will build up. Then our words will help form life together. Then our words will give witness to a destiny only visible through love. Talking together then is a practice aimed at eternity, and it matters more than we often realize for bringing our hope into focus. This finally is the goal of this book and the task I want to leave you with&mdash;to bring hope into focus.</p>

			 <p>Willie James Jennings, <em>After Whiteness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theological education could mark a new path for Western education, one that builds a vision of education that cultivates the new belonging that this world longs to inhabit. But we cannot give witness to that newness if we imagine that our fundamental struggle is one of institutional survival, or the challenge of educational delivery systems, or the alignment of financial modeling with our desired outcomes, or the expansion of pedagogical models. All these matters are important, but they are not where the struggle meets us or from where the vision of our futures will come.</p>

			 <p>Willie James Jennings, <em>After Whiteness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theological education is also about resistance. It is the seed from which may grow beautiful habitation or from which may grow mind-bending captivity. Yet how do you design for intellectual resistance? This may be the most pressing question in theological education today, because we theological educators are failing miserably at precisely this&mdash;at imagining a form of resistance that builds community.</p>

			 <p>I watched &ldquo;part 1&rdquo; of <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> earlier today. While I&rsquo;m enjoying this story more than, say, <em>The Mandalorian</em>, my experience viewing it is basically the same as the other Disney+ <em>Star Wars</em> series: I simply do not find them all that engaging. (The sequel films, especially <em>The Last Jedi</em>, are better in this respect, but they have their own problems; I find <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> unwatchable, far worse than the prequel trilogy.) The major problem for me, I think, is the enormous aesthetic gulf that exists between George Lucas&rsquo;s <em>Star Wars</em> and Disney&rsquo;s <em>Star Wars</em>. Lucas&rsquo;s excesses are probably to blame for the shortcomings of the prequel trilogy (though I don&rsquo;t find those films as horrendous as others do), but the most recent <em>Star Wars</em> entries feel to me more like Marvel movies than <em>Star Wars</em> films.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/topics/faith/devotional-reading/the-way-chapter-romero">one of √ìscar Romero&rsquo;s homilies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want peace, but not the peace of violence and of cemeteries, not peace imposed or extorted. We want peace that is the fruit of justice, peace that is the fruit of obedience to God, for God was expecting the righteousness and justice that his vineyard should have produced but got in return only murders. What we have of humanity and Christianity in El Salvador should have produced much peace, much right, much justice. How different our country would be if it were producing what God has planted here! It‚Äôs sad to say, but God feels he has failed with certain societies, and I think that the passages from Isaiah and Saint Paul that we read today have become a very sad Salvadoran reality: ‚ÄúI looked for righteousness, and behold, murders! I looked for justice, and behold, laments!‚Äù (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Is5.7">Isa. 5:7</a>).</p>

<p>Violence begets injury begets death, and any culture debased to vacillating between violent struggle and idle nihilism is shuddering toward its end as a culture of death. And a culture of death is like a prophecy, or a sickness: It bespeaks itself in worsening phases. Right now, we find ourselves foreclosing upon our own shared future both recklessly and deliberately‚Äîand perhaps, gradually, beginning to behave as if there is no future for us at all; soon, I sometimes worry, we may find ourselves faced with a darkening present, no faith in our future, and a doomed tendency to chase violence with violence.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://forward.com/culture/503637/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-uvalde/">Robert Zaretsky, on what a deeper appreciation of the word ‚Äòtragedy‚Äô reveals about tragedies like school shootings</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet if we could wring out the word‚Äôs semantic saturation, we might glimpse an earlier and more useful use of the word. A usage, in effect, that reminds us that tragedy remains Greek to us. In his recent book, <em>Tragedy, the Greeks and Us</em>, the philosopher Simon Critchley explores how the ancient Greek tragedians understood their world. Tragedy is not simply something that happens to us, the way that, say, a meteor happened to dinosaurs 65 million years ago or, for that matter, an earthquake happened to the residents of Lisbon 250 years ago. Both events were out of the control of its victims.</p>
<p>Not so with real tragedies, though. The works of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides reveal the human factor in the making of tragedy. As Critchley writes, ‚ÄúTragedy requires some degree of complicity on our part in the disaster that destroys us.‚Äù It is not that the gods did this to us, but that we collaborated with the gods to do this to us. The upshot, as Critchley makes clear, is terrifying: ‚ÄúTragedy requires our collusion with [our] fate. In other words, it requires no small measure of freedom.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a problem gets harder to solve, ignoring it becomes all the more tempting. Ignore it long enough, and eventually it becomes unsolvable. Giving up can then seem to deliver a measure of relief, in that it appears, at least for a moment, to liberate us from the agonies of our failing efforts. But such relief cannot last, as the unsolved problem will continue to create problems and cause suffering. This suffering rarely feels like freedom.</p>

			 <p>Maggie Nelson, discussing an interview given by Pema Ch√∂dt√∂n:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m riveted by this formulation, &ldquo;the environment was safe, but the teachings were threatening,&rdquo; as it names a paradox at the heart of much intellectual and artistic creation and pedagogy, one especially relevant for those of us who have devoted much of our lives to the contemplation and creation of transgressive work, as well as to supporting and respecting students. You can work to make a safe environment, but if the teachings at hand are meant to rattle, people are going to feel rattled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to reflect on this more in my own teaching. It seems to me that this describes (or should describe) what it is to teach Christian theology, particularly in the context of higher education. It seems to me the commitments and practices of Christianity destabilize the commitments and practices most students enter my classroom with;   they probably destabilize the commitments and practices they are taught by many other professors, too.</p>

			 <p>David Bentley Hart, in <em>Tradition and Apocalypse</em>, on the theological virtues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faith is the will to let the past be reborn in the present as more than what until now had been known, and the will to let the present be shaped by a future yet to be revealed. Hope is the conviction that that revelation will not only fulfill but far exceed the promise that the tradition preserves within itself. And, in the end, faith and hope will both pass away, or rather pass over into perfect love&mdash;which is, at the last, another name, and perhaps the highest, for that final horizon that calls all thought and all of creation to itself.</p>

			 <p>David Bentley Hart on tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tradition&rsquo;s life, it turns out, is an irrepressible apocalyptic ferment within, beckoning believers simultaneously back to an immemorial past and forward to an unimaginable future. The proper moral and spiritual attitude to tradition&rsquo;s formal expressions, if all of this is correct, would be not a simple clinging to what has been received, but also a relinquishing, even at times of things that had once seemed most precious: <em>Gelassenheit</em>, to use Eckhart&rsquo;s language, release. Only thus can one receive tradition as a liberating counterhistory, as the apocalyptic exception to bare history that promises believers a higher truth than death: by remembering a first interruption, awaiting a last interruption, and attempting to sustain the theme uniting them in the interval. Only thus can the faithful find the meaninglessness of bare history converted into a completed tale of vocation and judgment, of a call heard from far away that nevertheless summons them to a promised homeland.</p>

			 <p>A recent eBay acquisition: a Pentax K1000 35mm film camera. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get into film photography for a while now, and I was recently struck by an urge to find a good beginner&rsquo;s camera to get started. The K1000 seemed the clear choice for a number of reason: its availability, its price, its simplicity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What I like about this camera is its fully mechanical operation: though it does have a battery, that battery only powers the built-in light meter. Otherwise, the camera operates completely mechanically‚Äîand you can really feel it when you release the shutter.</p>
<p>The camera has basically no features at all, apart from the light meter: manual focus, manual exposure. Its lack of features was another selling point to me. I want little more than the absolute basics as I get into film photography. There&rsquo;s something about the bare bones simplicity of the K1000 that seems to lend the photos it shoots with honesty and integrity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a few shots just around town, mainly getting a feel for the camera and testing out different exposures. I&rsquo;m hoping to get through a roll in a week or so, so I can send the film off to be developed and see how accurate the light meter is.</p>

<p>No. 123. Whenever I speak of faith, I am not speaking of faith in God. Likewise, when I speak of doubt, I am not talking about doubting God&rsquo;s existence, or the truth of any gospel. Such terms have never meant very much to me. To contemplate them reminds me of playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey: you get spun around until you wander off, disoriented and blindfolded, walking gingerly with a hand stretched out in front of you, until you either run into a wall (laughter), or a friend gently pushes you back toward the game.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>No. 125. Of course, you could also just take off the blindfold and say, <em>I think this game is stupid, and I&rsquo;m not playing it anymore</em>. And it must also be admitted that hitting the wall or wandering off in the wrong direction or tearing off the blindfold is as much a part of the game as is pinning the tail on the donkey.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hearing each other&rsquo;s voices, individual thoughts, and sometimes associating theses voices [sic] with personal experience makes us more acutely aware of each other. That moment of collective participation and dialogue means that students and professor respect&mdash;and here I invoke the root meaning of the word, &ldquo;to look&rdquo;&mdash;at each other, engage in acts of recognition with one another, and do not just talk to the professor. Sharing experiences and confessional narratives in the classroom helps establish communal commitment to learning. These narrative moments usually are the space where the assumption that we share a common class background and perspective is disrupted. While students may be open to the idea that they do not all come from a common class background, they may still expect that the values of materially privileged groups will be the class&rsquo;s norm.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s important to remind students that joy can be present <em>along with hard work</em>. Not every moment in the classroom will necessarily be one that brings you immediate pleasure, but that doesn&rsquo;t preclude the possibility of joy. Nor does it deny the reality that learning can be painful. And sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary to remind students and colleagues that pain and painful situations don&rsquo;t necessarily translate into harm. We make that very fundamental mistake all the time.

Like Bauerschmidt, I used Herbert McCabe&rsquo;s image of evil as hole-in-sock to try to balance both <em>privatio boni</em> and our real experience of evil as surd.

			 <p>Daniel Walden, <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/one-more-lifeless-idol">in a review of a very bad recent book</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of us [on the political left] came to our politics precisely because we do sense that we have unchosen obligations to the people around us, and some people may have childhood memories of strong neighborhood or community bonds that made it easy for them to wander around safely, or of large family gatherings that included people who were not blood relatives but might as well have been. People <em>should</em> be able to let their children wander freely around safe neighborhoods; they should be able to form strong relationships with their neighbors and fellow local citizens, go to silly productions at the community theater, and shop for the things they need at stores owned and run by people who live alongside them. And if the community where they live doesn‚Äôt provide what they need to be happy, they should be able to find one that does. I am sure that such communities, were people able to live in them, would develop local traditions and institutions that would help cement people‚Äôs connection to one another, and I view it as the role of the state to underwrite the basic necessities of life for every person precisely so that we will be free to form the sorts of communities that will nourish us and let us form the loving relationships that sustain human life.</p>

<p>When Christians prepare to approach the LORD in eucharistic worship, they do so haltingly, repeatedly underlining in the words they speak that what they are about to do cannot be done. Even after the bread and wine have been consecrated before the congregation‚Äôs face and offered to it, and even after the declaration is made that those who can receive the body and blood are happy‚Äîblessed‚Äîto be able to do so, the congregation declares that it is incapable of receiving what is offered, echoing, in doing so, the scriptural words of the Roman centurion who asks Jesus to heal his servant: <em>non sum dignus ut intres sub tectum meum, sed tantum dic verbo et sanabitur anima mea</em> (I‚Äôm not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed). All theological discourse works under this rubric: <em>non sum dignus &hellip; tantum dic verbo</em>. Theologians, whether believers or not, lovers of the LORD or not, need to remember this so that theology, rather than something else, is what they do.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-dawn-of-everything-a-new-history-of-humanity/9780374157357">David Graeber &amp; David Wengrow&rsquo;s <em>The Dawn of Everything</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>American citizens have the right to travel wherever they like ‚Äì provided, of course, they have the money for transport and accommodation. They are free from ever having to obey the arbitrary orders of superiors ‚Äì unless, of course, they have to get a job. In this sense, it is almost possible to say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people">the Wendat</a> had play chiefs and real freedoms, while most of us today have to make do with real chiefs and play freedoms. Or to put the matter more technically: what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people">the Hadza</a>, Wendat or ‚Äòegalitarian‚Äô people such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuer_people">the Nuer</a> seem to have been concerned with were not so much formal freedoms as substantive ones. They were less interested in the right to travel than in the possibility of actually doing so (hence, the matter was typically framed as an obligation to provide hospitality to strangers). Mutual aid ‚Äì what contemporary European observers often referred to as ‚Äòcommunism‚Äô ‚Äì was seen as the necessary condition for individual autonomy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Graeber &amp; Wengrow invent this distinction&mdash;I assume not&mdash;but distinguishing &lsquo;formal&rsquo; freedoms from &lsquo;substantive&rsquo; freedoms is helpful. My sense is that the political left in the United States has largely ceded talk of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to the right; you don&rsquo;t often (or, at least, I don&rsquo;t often) encounter arguments for leftist politics on the basis of freedom. But in fact, I think, the left does want &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; for people and their proposals can help facilitate such freedom. The difference is the left is less concerned with formal freedom (the concern of the right) than it is with substantive freedom.</p>
<p>This is one piece of Graeber &amp; Wengrow&rsquo;s work that I really appreciate. They repeatedly stress that American indigenous peoples had a worldview closer to the contemporary US than European Enlightenment thinkers, because American indigenous peoples were concerned with (substantive) freedom. It&rsquo;s a clever rhetorical move: both the original inhabitants of the American continents and the present inhabitants of the American continents are interested in freedom; the difference is, in what that freedom consists.</p>

			 <p>David Bentley Hart, on one&rsquo;s just deserts before God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remain convinced that no one, logically speaking, could merit eternal punishment; but I also accept
the obverse claim that no one could merit grace. This does not mean, however, that grace must be rare in order to be truly gracious, as so many in the infernalist party so casually assume it must. Grace universally given is still grace. A gift made to everyone is no less a gift, and a gift that is intrinsically precious need not be rare to be an act of the highest generosity. Conversely, that gift becomes no more precious‚Äîindeed, it becomes much less so‚Äîif it is certified in its value by being distributed only parsimoniously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor does this mean calling for forgiveness when it involves renouncing our own rights, confronting corrupt officials, criminals or those who would debase our dignity. We are called to love everyone, without exception; at the same time, loving an oppressor does not mean allowing him to keep oppressing us, or letting him think that what he does is acceptable. On the contrary, true love for an oppressor means seeking ways to make him cease his oppression; it means stripping him of a power that he does not know how to use, and that diminishes his own humanity and that of others. Forgiveness does not entail allowing oppressors to keep trampling on their own dignity and that of others, or letting criminals continue their wrongdoing. Those who suffer injustice have to defend strenuously their own rights and those of their family, precisely because they must preserve the dignity they have received as a loving gift from God. If a criminal has harmed me or a loved one, no one can forbid me from demanding justice and ensuring that this person ‚Äì or anyone else ‚Äì will not harm me, or others, again. This is entirely just; forgiveness does not forbid it but actually demands it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freud said that mourning is a &ldquo;great riddle,&rdquo; and its greatness partially consists in its not being the kind of riddle that gets solved. Mourning, he says, is &ldquo;one of those phenomena which cannot themselves be explained but to which other obscurities can be traced back.&rdquo; In essence, mourning is one of the ways we exercise our capacity for love. We get attached to people and ideals, thoughts and projects that are themselves vulnerable. And we respond to that vulnerability by becoming active ourselves in making sense of what it all meant or will continue to mean. Other animals suffer loss; other animals grieve in complex ways. If we want, we can call that mourning. But our form of mourning is an attempt to turn loss into a reanimated gain&mdash;in imagination, thought, emotion and, importantly, symbolic expression. We make human meanings, and when we can share these meanings publicly it is constitutive of the formation of culture. Aristotle lived; Aristotle died: it is only our activity that transforms this change into loss and into a certain kind of gain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reading Beauvoir‚Äôs work alongside Weil‚Äôs can make it clear that freedom exists not only in what we do but in what we do not do. Rising to the challenge of our freedom does not mean living a life of hedonism or selfishness. It might mean living more like Weil‚Äîtaking what you need, and giving away the surplus‚Äîwith the caveat that one takes what one actually needs. With the acceptance of our moral freedom comes a widening of our moral imagination‚Äîthat we do not have to relegate heroism to others or tell ourselves comforting stories to get through our lives.</p>

			 <p>Phil Christman, <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/the-ancient-and-never-ending-campaign">&ldquo;Misfortune Is Not a Communicable Disease&rdquo;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, what mystifies me is the insistence on acting like <em>having to see or talk to</em> the homeless is <em>in itself</em> a social problem, not <em>because they‚Äôre homeless</em> but because <em>you had to see it</em>. I think I‚Äôm a pretty sinful person, but that feeling I simply don‚Äôt relate to. If the person is screaming at you or following you or physically attacking you, you‚Äôre within your rights to get mad, obviously, as you would at anyone who does those things, but if the person is simply standing there and asking you for a tenner, you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, man, I don‚Äôt have it, but good luck‚Äù and you keep walking. To feel anger at that person (rather than at, say, the mayor, or the governor, or the President, or God, or yourself) just makes no sense to me, except as the expression of a deep, atavistic human instinct that tells us that misery is a contagious disease.</p>

			 <p>Agnes Callard, <a href="https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/why-am-i-being-hurt/">on Simone Weil&rsquo;s useful distinction between suffering and affliction</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of our frustrations with our children lie in the fact that they have not yet learned to find certain forms of‚Äîtrivial, mundane‚Äîsuffering to be intelligible. Young children do not seem to understand any suffering. Yet even after we exit childhood, we are guaranteed to encounter misfortunes that surpass our understanding. If Weil is right, the form that these experiences take is interrogative: the expression of affliction, because it is a request for understanding, comes in the form of a question.</p>

			 <p>Something that&rsquo;s long irritiated me is when people excuse their own rudeness or cruelty by claiming to be &ldquo;blunt&rdquo; or &ldquo;brutally honest.&rdquo; That may be, but more often than not, I find that such people actually just can&rsquo;t be bothered to put in the effort to be polite to other people by filtering out whatever happens to pop into their head. <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/cruelty-isnt-clarity">Phil Christman&rsquo;s comments</a> on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/style/marriage-heather-havrilesky-foreverland.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">that recent terrible NYT piece about hating one&rsquo;s spouse</a> offer further insight on a similar phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I run into this assumption all the time, that the meanest take or harshest thought you might have about someone else, the most reductive, one-datum-reflected-in-a-funhouse-mirror-so-it‚Äôs-all-you-see sort of vision, is held up as some truth that we‚Äôre normally too weak to face. A person who is casually cruel always defends themselves by saying ‚ÄúWell at least I‚Äôm honest.‚Äù Honesty about <em>what is running through your head right this second</em> isn‚Äôt the same as <em>honesty in the sense of actually making the effort to get other people and things right</em>. The second thing takes forever, which is one reason why a marriage does.</p>

<p>Frodo, of Gollum: It&rsquo;s a pity Bilbo didn&rsquo;t kill him when he had the chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo&rsquo;s hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked this line from Peter Jackson&rsquo;s adaptation of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>&mdash;very similar to the original in Tolkien&rsquo;s novel, but slightly more economical. I&rsquo;m not sure I would agree now that &ldquo;many that live deserve death&rdquo;&mdash;that seems overharsh&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not sure that the reason we should be slow to deal out death is because of a certain near-sightedness; as if someone with farther and keener vision might be so entitled to deal out death.</p>
<p>Indeed, I would probably want to switch the two quantities Gandalf uses here: perhaps it is the case that some that live deserve death; it is certainly the case that many that die deserve life. That alone&mdash;that a great many people are dealt death rather than life when they are born into poverty, when they are denied necessary medical care, when they are incarcerated at rates disproportionate to their crime, when they are killed by the state, when they are victims of violence, etc., etc.&mdash;that alone should give us pause before further perpetuating death. Death, once dealt, cannot be withdrawn; not by us.</p>
<p>I like, too, how Gandalf recommends pity as a sort of default disposition toward those we encounter; not pity in a patronizing or paternalistic sense, but rather pity as a fellow-feeling of compassion for the sufferings or distresses of others.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/">Phil Christman</a>, on why cops are cops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not every cop is Eric Adams, still less Darren Wilson or Derek Chauvin, but how likely is it that even the nicest one isn‚Äôt held in place, socially, and held in <em>power</em>, socially, by colleagues who think exactly what Eric Adams does? By people whose highest loyalty is not to you, and not, <em>pace</em> <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11505/11505-h/11505-h.htm#THOUGHTS_AROUND_KOEPENICK">Chesterton</a>, to some abstract idea symbolized by a badge, but to force?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking about <a href="https://www.wonkette.com/eric-adams-wore-a-bullet-proof-vest-for-22-years-hes-new-yorks-infallible-god-king-mayor-now">Eric Adams reinstating solitary confinement in New York City jails</a>. Though the function of police is purportedly &ldquo;to serve and protect,&rdquo; the reality of policing in the United States suggests a different motivation than service or protection (or, at least, it is not the whole of a community whom cops are serving and protecting): perhaps cops, even good cops, are cops because (as Christman elsewhere puts it) &ldquo;they actually kinda do like force as such.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Thomas Merton (in <em>Raids on the Unspeakable</em>) on the nativity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Into this world, this demented inn, in which there is absolutely no room for Him at all, Christ has come uninvited. But because He cannot be at home in it, because He is out of place in it, and yet He must be in it, His place is with those others for whom there is no room. His place is with those who do not belong, who are rejected by power because they are regarded as weak, those who are discredited, who are denied the status of persons, tortured, exterminated. With those for whom there is no room, Christ is present in this world. He is mysteriously present in those for whom there seems to be nothing but the world at its worst. For them, there is no escape even in imagination. They cannot identify with the power structure of a crowded humanity which seeks to project itself outward, anywhere, in a centrifugal flight into the void, to get <em>out there</em> where there is no God, no man, no name, no identity, no weight, no self, nothing but the bright, self-directed, perfectly obedient and infinitely expensive machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For those who are stubborn enough, devoted enough to power, there remains this last apocalyptic myth of machinery propagating its own kind in the eschatological wilderness of space&mdash;while on earth the bombs make room!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the others: they remain imprisoned in other hopes, and in more pedestrian despairs, despairs and hopes which are held down to earth, down to street level, and to the pavement only: desire to be at least half-human, to taste a little human joy, to do a fairly decent job of productive work, to come home to the family &hellip; desires for which there is no room. It is in these that He hides Himself, for whom there is no room.</p>

			 <p>It took me a semester, but I finally got some art on my office door. This means‚ÄîI believe‚ÄîI&rsquo;m a real professor now.</p>
<p>I really like how <em>Raiders</em>, <em>Arrival</em>, and Francis of Assisi look together. Dorothy Day upsets the aesthetic balance a bit, but that picture is too good not to include.</p>

			 <p>From Alberto Manguel&rsquo;s <em>A History of Reading</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep down the production costs he [Aldus Manutius] decided to print a thousand copies at a time, and to use the page more economically he employed a newly designed type, &ldquo;italic&rdquo;, created by the Bolognese punch-cutter Francesco Griffo, who also cut the first roman type in which the capitals were shorter than the ascending (full-height) letters of the lower case to ensure a better-balanced line. The result was a book that appeared much plainer than the ornate manuscript editions popular throughout the Middle Ages, a volume of elegant sobriety. What counted above all, for the owner of an Aldine pocket-book, was the text, clearly and eruditely printed&mdash;not a preciously decorated object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m painting in very broad strokes here, but it seems to me something else at play (aside from economics and consumer preferences) is shifting aesthetics brought on by the protestant reformation.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/fleet-foxes/robin-pecknold-interview-a-very-lonely-solstice/">Matt Mitchell&rsquo;s description</a> of Fleet Foxes' music is right on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pecknold‚Äôs early compositions and stacked vocal harmonies mirrored Phil Spector‚Äôs Wall of Sound technique, just as Brian Wilson‚Äôs <em>Pet Sounds</em> and <em>SMILE</em> compositions had previously; his lyrics captured the symbiotic relationship between cinematic heartbreak and autumnal folklore unearthed from the quixotic Pacific Northwest landscape he was raised in.</p>

<p>Mitchell reviews Robin Pecknold&rsquo;s recently released performance of several Fleet Foxes tracks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VB24LYsE60"><em>A Very Lonely Solstice</em></a>.</p>

			 <p>Thomas of Celano&rsquo;s description of the youthful Francis is so good: ‚ÄúThat man was still boiling in the sins of youthful heat‚Äù (Enimvero cum adhue vir iste iuvenili calore in peccatis fervesceret)! Of course, Thomas may be (is likely) exaggerating, but still.</p>

			 <p>I tried a different scoring pattern on today‚Äôs loaf, to somewhat disappointing results. Rather than my usual single, long score, slightly off-center, I tried four smaller strokes in a roughly cruciform pattern. I had intended the four scores to open up more evenly, hoping for a more balanced rise. Really only two of the scores opened as fully as I&rsquo;d hoped, but the loaf rose pretty evenly all the same.</p>
