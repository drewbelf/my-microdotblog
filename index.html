<p><em>Correction</em>: I&rsquo;ve been informed that &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop Believin‚Äô‚Äù is more representative of Gen X than boomer culture.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It was winter in Italy, eight hundred years ago, &amp; Assisi‚Äôs <em>poverello</em> had an idea.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Francis of Assisi had become obsessed with the words &amp; deeds of Jesus Christ, his rustic parables &amp; simple gestures that, despite (or perhaps because of) their lowliness, communicated divine majesty &amp; awe. According to an early biographer,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> ‚Äúso thoroughly did the humility of the incarnation &amp; the charity of the passion occupy his memory that he scarcely wanted to think of anything else.‚Äù Francis was always imagining new ways to convey this humility &amp; charity to anyone who would listen.</p>
<p>Out of his deep reflection on the ‚Äúpoor &amp; humble Jesus Christ,‚Äù Francis hatched a plan to celebrate the feast of the Lord‚Äôs nativity, to bring to life the good news that Christmas promises. He led a pair of animals‚Äîan ox &amp; a donkey‚Äîinto a cave near the town of Greccio, about midway between Rome and Assisi. He spread hay on the cave‚Äôs floor &amp; set up a manger there. Into that manger he gently laid a sleeping infant. It was Christmas Eve, &amp; Francis of Assisi had staged a living nativity scene.</p>
<p>Francis called his fellow friars to assemble, &amp; the townspeople came out, too, despite the chill in the air. St. Bonaventure describes the light &amp; warmth Francis brought into that cold, dark night:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The brethren are summoned,<br>
the people arrive,<br>
the forest amplifies with their cries,<br>
&amp; that venerable night is rendered<br>
brilliant &amp; solemn<br>
by a multitude of bright lights<br>
&amp; by resonant &amp; harmonious hymns of praise.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Francis brought to life with startling clarity in his Christmas cr√®che is the scandalous claim that lies at the heart of Christianity: that when God enters the world, God enters as a helpless child, squirming in swaddling clothes &amp; tugging at his mother‚Äôs breast. Mary gives birth not in a comfortable, sanitary room at the inn, attended to by midwives &amp; physicians, but rather <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A2-20&amp;version=RSVCE">in a dirty barn, as beasts of burden and shepherds look on</a>. God is welcomed into the world not by a rich and powerful family, but rather by <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+2%3A13-15&amp;version=RSVCE">poor, refugee parents</a> who are <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+1%3A18-25&amp;version=RSVCE">the object of rumor &amp; reproach</a>. This is the nativity of the Lord of the universe! We are told that, on that night, ‚Äúsimplicity is given a place of honor, poverty is exalted, &amp; humility is commended.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>What Francis teaches us members of the St. Bonaventure University community, we who are heir to the Franciscan tradition, is that holiness is not found among the powerful and the privileged. Holiness is not found in status or comfort. Holiness cannot be bought. Rather, if we wish to find holiness, we must look for it in what is considered lowly &amp; unworthy. We must look for holiness among the rejected &amp; outcast &amp; marginalized. We must look for holiness where we do not expect to find it. Indeed, perhaps holiness is most fully encountered in exactly the places and persons we <em>least</em> expect to find it.</p>
<p>This, indeed, is the reason for the season. This is what Christmas celebrates. What Francis proclaims at Christmas is God‚Äôs movement into solidarity with the poor &amp; the vulnerable, as one who is poor &amp; vulnerable, in order that God may <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201%3A46-55&amp;version=RSVCE">‚Äúraise up the lowly, and fill the hungry with good things.‚Äù</a> Francis‚Äôs Christmas cr√®che invites us to contemplate this mystery &amp; sends us forth to go &amp; do likewise.</p>

			 <p>In which I watched <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, &amp; <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>; &amp; read <em>Questioning God</em>, <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, <em>Revelations of Divine Love</em>, &amp; <em>Julian of Norwich, Theologian</em>.</p>
<p><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> (Martin Scorsese, 2023). What an amazing film. I don&rsquo;t even want to say much about it here, because I know I can&rsquo;t do it justice in the space of a short paragraph. Each performance&mdash;especially Lily Gladstone&rsquo;s &amp; Leonardo DiCaprio&rsquo;s&mdash;is exactly what it should be. If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, go see it.</p>
<p><em>The Blair Witch Project</em> (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S√°nchez, 1999). I remember <em>Paranormal Activity</em> being huge when I was in high school; I was at the time too scared of scary movies, but I remember being intrigued by the &ldquo;found footage&rdquo; conceit. (I guess that style of horror was a little overdone, even by 2007.) <em>Blair Witch Project</em> is the film that mainstreamed found footage. What an incredible film! I thought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_lqGnLtWA">Heather Donahue</a> was so good, &amp; the night scenes were so spooky &amp; effective. &amp; that last shot! Learning more about its production from <a href="https://www.unspooledpodcast.com/">the Unspooled podcast</a> really deepened my appreciation for it, too.</p>
<p><em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em> (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2017). I decided to watch this more or less at random one night while Jacqueline was out of town&mdash;Netflix recommended it to me, &amp; it seemed like a film that I would enjoy and Jac would not. I was certainly right about that. It made me want to see more of Lanthimos&rsquo;s work (&amp; as it happens I was already looking forward to his <em>Poor Things</em>, even before watching this film).</p>
<p><em>Questioning God</em> (Timothy Radcliffe &amp; ≈Åukasz Popko, 2023). One of my professors in undergrad said Timothy Radcliffe &amp; I had a &ldquo;similar style,&rdquo; &amp; ever since then I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out what he means. (I took it, and still take it, as a compliment, though I&rsquo;m still not quite sure what my professor saw in me.) I found this book a little disappointing. It&rsquo;s written as a dialogue between the coauthors, but I&rsquo;m not sure that format was particularly effective. My favorite part of the book was the epilogue, which was not formatted as a dialogue (&amp; so, I assume, was more properly &ldquo;cowritten&rdquo;). I understand why they wrote the book as a dialogue&mdash;the book is about dialogue between God &amp; humans&mdash;but it didn&rsquo;t totally work for me.</p>
<p><em>Ways of Seeing</em> (John Berger, 1972). Every piece of art has an ideology encoded into it. You&rsquo;ve heard of the male gaze; Berger&rsquo;s analysis of the history of the female nude shows what that means. I have to think that Matt Weiner had the last chapter in mind when he created <em>Mad Men</em>: <a href="https://youtu.be/fjg5TuXV09U?si=-BRxfq7KSGTohyOT">‚ÄúWhat you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons‚Äù</a>.</p>
<p><em>Revelations of Divine Love</em> (Julian of Norwich, ca. late 14th century). I&rsquo;ve read Julian&rsquo;s <em>Shewings</em> a number of times before, but this time I was reading it for a chapter I&rsquo;m writing. I was especially struck at Julian&rsquo;s insistence on the goodness &amp; mercy of God, which makes for a fruitful contrast with her sustained reflections on suffering &amp; Christ&rsquo;s passion.</p>
<p><em>Julian of Norwich, Theologian</em> (Denys Turner, 2011). Wow, what a work. Turner&rsquo;s account of Julian&rsquo;s &ldquo;two stories‚Äù&mdash;the story sin tells about itself, &amp; the story that God tells about sin&mdash;is so illuminating. This book makes me want to design my entire Catholic Theology course around Julian&rsquo;s <em>Shewings</em>. (I won&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t have time &hellip; but maybe someday.)</p>
<p>I also kept a log in <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/10/31/movies-in-october.html">October 2023</a>.</p>

<p>In the servant is comprehended the seconde person of the trinite, and in the servant is comprehended Adam: that is to sey, all men.

When Adam felle, Godes sonne fell. For the rightful oning which was made in heven, Goddes sonne might not be seperath from Adam, for by Adam I understond alle man. Adam fell fro life to deth: into the slade of this wreched worlde, and after that into hell.

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780300164688">Turner on Julian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps Julian&rsquo;s central theological insight that sin wages war against love because sin is of its own nature violent, but love wages no wars at all, not even against sin, for love is absolute vulnerability. Love knows no other strategy than that vulnerability. For that reason, then, neither is any subsequent reversal of the Cross&rsquo;s violent defeat necessary, for it is precisely in that victory of sin over love that sin is defeated. In its victory over love sin defeats itself. Sin&rsquo;s failure to engage perfect love in a contest on sin&rsquo;s terms of violence &amp; power <em>is</em> sin&rsquo;s defeat, its power being exhausted by its very success. For killing is the best strategy that sin can come up with; it is sin&rsquo;s last resort. The Resurrection, then, is the meaning of the Cross, the meaning that the vulnerability of love, its refusal of the sword, is stronger than sin&rsquo;s power to kill. That is all we know. That is all we can know. The meaning of the Cross neither allows for a fairy-tale ending nor needs one.</p>

<p>Julian &hellip; systematically refuses to finish, because she intends theological incompleteness. And she intends theological incompleteness on grounds that are themselves theological, or at least meta-theological, that is to say, because she knows that what alone completes the theological is also what transcends its powers, namely, the beatific vision. The theologian, in short, is forced to raise more questions than she can answer, for the questions that perforce arise within the limits of theology of necessity can be answered for now only inaccessibly beyond it. Of theological necessity, then, is her &ldquo;boke not yet performed.&rdquo;</p>

By piety I mean actions which we take whether or not we mean them sincerely, because they are part of values we want to practice. We believe in believing in these things, as it were. These are actions that embody things we want to want, or even want to want to want. And these actions transcend our intentions. It‚Äôs more important than however you feel about it.</p>

			 <p>I thought it might be fun at the end of each month to list the movies I&rsquo;d seen that month &amp; some thoughts about each.</p>
<p><em>Rope</em> (Alfred Hitchcock, 1948). Jacqueline &amp; I decided to watch some Hitchcock in honor of Halloween at the end of the month. We&rsquo;ve seen a few Hitchcock already, but not <em>Rope</em>. I enjoyed it, though it&rsquo;s not my favorite of his (that remains <em>Psycho</em>). I love good, long scenes, &amp; Hitchcock&rsquo;s clever camera work to make the entire film seem like a single take really ratchets up the tension.</p>
<p><em>Scream</em> (Wes Craven, 1996). I&rsquo;d seen bits of the recent <em>Scream</em> reboot on someone else&rsquo;s screen on an international flight a couple years ago, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve actually watched a <em>Scream</em> film start to finish. It was great! It was meta without being too in-your-face about it (with maybe an exception or two here or there), &amp; there were some unexpected resonances with <em>Rope</em> (chiefly in the homoerotic subtext between Billy &amp; Stu). The opening sequence is genuinely frightening, &amp; killing off Drew Barrymore at the very beginning is brilliant. I have little interest in the rest of the franchise, but this was a good one.</p>
<p><em>The Greatest Showman</em> (Michael Gracey, 2017). One of my students watched my favorite movie, <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, &amp; insisted I watch this movie in return. I&rsquo;ll confess, I didn&rsquo;t love it. The music really didn&rsquo;t do anything, and the story felt pretty tepid (surprising, considering the actual history of P.T. Barnum&rsquo;s life).</p>
<p><em>The Birds</em> (Alfred Hitchcock, 1963). Another Hitchcock in honor of Halloween month. Amazing how threatening Hitchcock makes birds seem&mdash;the scene as the birds gather outside the schoolhouse!&mdash;&amp; how he used <em>real birds</em> for almost the entire movie.</p>
<p><em>A Serious Man</em> (Joel Coen &amp; Ethan Coen, 2009). I watched this movie as a candidate for the <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/10/30/ive-been-spending.html">theology &amp; film course I&rsquo;m designing</a>. I think it&rsquo;ll make the syllabus. The film obviously engages the book of Job but also has some pretty significant differences. I think it will make for great discussion, to bring this film into dialogue with its source material.</p>
<p><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (Wes Craven, 1984). Another Wes Craven to finish out October. I thought this was pretty good, though I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much as <em>Scream</em>. It had some creepy sequences but I think I really only jumped once or twice (&amp; I tend to be very jumpy during scary movies). I liked Nancy&rsquo;s character. That last sequence was very confusing though (&amp; apparently an addition at the insistence of the producer). I&rsquo;d like to see <em>Wes Craven&rsquo;s New Nightmare</em> now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hoped to see <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> this month, but it was a very busy month at work. I&rsquo;m planning to see it in the next week or so.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time recently working on a syllabus for a new &ldquo;theology through film&rdquo; course. I hope to have the course approved this semester so I can teach it next fall. Some other responsibilities (research) are suffering some neglect, but it&rsquo;s very exciting to see the course coming together.</p>

			 <p>One of the best changes I made to my syllabus for <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/23/on-teaching-francis.html">The Way of Francis &amp; Clare</a> is assigning <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780811217248?title=New+Seeds+of+Contemplation&amp;author=Thomas+Merton&amp;cover_id=121897">Thomas Merton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Things in Their Identity‚Äù</a> early in the semester. Reading that chapter gave us a chance to talk about Merton&rsquo;s understanding of the true and false selves, which is how I presented spirituality to students: spirituality is the process of coming to know &amp; live one&rsquo;s true self. But besides giving us a working understanding of spirituality, that true self/false self framework has made for a surprising throughline across the course. Students (&amp; I) are constantly referring back to true self &amp; false self as we make sense of Francis &amp; Clare&rsquo;s lives &amp; spiritualities. It&rsquo;s made for some excellent in-class discussion!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>St. Anselm &amp; St. Bernard are the chief influences in our period in making intelligible the spiritual impulses of their contemporaries. But before leaving them, one name must be mentioned which represents the climax of the developments we have been discussing: the name of St. Francis. The period of his public career from 1209 to 1226 lies outside the scope of this book, but he is the embodiment of the spirit of Christian romance which we have watched in some aspects of its development from the time of St. Anselm. The inward quest of St. Anselm or St. Bernard&mdash;faith seeking understand, or carnal love seeking its spiritual object&mdash;was given an external symbolism in the homeless, wandering, unsheltered life of the beggar. The most negative &amp; drabbest of the monastic virtues&mdash;Poverty&mdash;was transformed Cinderella-like into a fairy princess, &amp; invested with the fascinating qualities of a romantic heroine. Above all, the tender, passionate love of Jesus had its earthly consummation in the vision of the Crucified &amp; the crisis of the stigmata on Monte Alverna in 1224. With St. Francis &amp; his followers, the fruits of the experiences of St. Anselm &amp; St. Bernard were brought to the market place, &amp; became the common property of the lay &amp; clerical world alike.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t like him as much as I used to, but Lewis&rsquo;s <em>Screwtape Letters</em> has some wildly funny moments. Like this one, as Screwtape acknowledges evil as a <em>privatio boni</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never forget that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy &amp; normal &amp; satisfying form, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy&rsquo;s ground. I know we have won many a soul through pleasure. All the same, it is His invention, not ours. He made the pleasures: all our research so far has not enabled us to produce one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The asymmetry of the Logos&mdash;through whom all things were made&mdash;in relation to created being means that the act of incarnation overdetermines every finite becoming; the transformative reality of the Son resides for us wholly in the Incarnate fact of his being <em>ex Maria</em>. What the Son receives <em>ex Maria</em> does not change the eternal Son; rather it unleashes the transformative power of his divine being into our human world. This is more or less what <a href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/summa/TP/TP002.html#TPQ2A7THEP1">the mixed relation ensures in Thomas</a>: the whole becoming, the whole drama of the eternal &ldquo;is&rdquo; of the Logos resides in the life of Jesus, thus foreclosing (1) every simple transition from the Incarnate Son to the (as if temporally &ldquo;before‚Äù) pre-Incarnate Son, while ensuring that (2) it is precisely our human reality that is changed by his divine act.</p>

<p>The Incarnation remains a mystery. But, perhaps, Aquinas can help us to see that we don&rsquo;t therefore have to talk nonsense about it.</p>

<p>I would add (&amp; I&rsquo;m certain McCabe would agree) that this goes for not only Aquinas but for any good theology. Indeed, that&rsquo;s not a bad way to put the task of theology: learning how not to speak nonsense about mystery.</p>

			 <p>(Well, not quite Theology 101; rather, <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/06/23/on-teaching-francis.html">Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies 101</a>, which isn&rsquo;t exactly an intro to theology.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finally getting close to a &ldquo;final form&rdquo; for my sections of <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/general-education-curriculum/learning-goals-objectives">&ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.‚Äù</a> The course schedule, including reading assignments, is mostly set, but what&rsquo;s really tied together the entire course is the integration of a service learning project throughout the semester.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, students take what they learn about Franciscan values to design, plan, &amp; implement a service project that does some good for the local community. Afterwards they will write a reflective essay in which they discuss their experience of service in connection with key themes &amp; ideas from the course. I was inspired to work this project into my course by my colleague, who had used service learning in the past, &amp; students responded well to the project last semester. This semester I&rsquo;ve worked to more fully integrate the project into my course, mainly by orienting all the other writing assignments in the course to the service learning project.</p>
<p>Early in the semester, students will write a short essay articulating their understanding of &ldquo;Franciscan service,&rdquo; on the basis of a couple of readings we&rsquo;ll discuss in class (including selections of Pope Francis&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html">Fratelli tutti</a></em>). This writing assignment will ask them to consider the difference between service &amp; solidarity, &amp; how they might embody solidarity in their own acts of service. This early writing assignment will help students begin to think about service in a Franciscan key, &amp; what they might want to do for their service project. (We&rsquo;ll also have time in class to brainstorm ideas &amp; begin planning projects.)</p>
<p>Later on in the semester students will complete an in-class positionality mapping exercise (I learned a lot about this from <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1609406919870075">Danielle Jacobson&rsquo;s &amp; Nida Mustafa&rsquo;s paper on social identity mapping</a>), which will form the basis of their second writing assignment. I don&rsquo;t ask students to share with me anything about their social position they&rsquo;re not comfortable sharing, but I do ask them to reflect in writing on how their social position informs their own particular worldview. That includes possible blind spots they may have as a consequence of their social position; that also includes a unique perspective or insight about the world they have thanks to their social position. My hope&mdash;&amp; I&rsquo;ll be explicit about this in class&mdash;is that students will think about the position <em>from which</em> they engage in service. What is it about their social location that puts them in a position to do service at all? How do their intersecting social positions inform they kind of good they want to do in their community?</p>
<p>Then, in the latter half of the semester, students will write a couple short essays on Franciscan values. I&rsquo;ve already identified most of the possible values (e.g., non-possessiveness, fraternal living, universal kinship, peacemaking, etc.); students will choose one, find a quotation from Francis or Clare to illustrate it, &amp; then explain the value. These will come into play when students are reflecting on their experience in the service learning project.</p>
<p>Finally, for the end of the semester students write a reflective essay drawing on their experience completing the service learning project. The reflective essay has a few parts to it. I&rsquo;ll ask them to think about to what extent their service learning project met the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; of Franciscan service they set in their first writing assignment. Students won&rsquo;t be graded on how &ldquo;Franciscan&rdquo; their project was; rather, I want students to think about how service does &amp; does not allow for the &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;&mdash;the change of social position&mdash;that Francis &amp; Clare lived in their own time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also ask students to think about how their social position may have shaped their experience of doing service. The goal here is that putting service in the context of one&rsquo;s social position will discourage the &ldquo;it felt so good to help someone&rdquo; attitude toward service, which I worry is patronizing &amp; shortcircuits questions about why we live in a world where such service is needed. Instead, I&rsquo;d like students to think more critically about themselves &amp; society&mdash;what about their privilege positions them to do service like this? How might students choose to live in ways that counteract the societal arrangements that marginalize or oppress people?</p>
<p>Students will further reflect on Franciscan values in connection with their experience of service. They might use what we learned in the classroom to analyze &amp; interpret their experience, or they might use their experience to shed new light on the ideas learned &amp; discussed in class.</p>
<p>The reflective essay, then, draws upon each of the previous writing assignments while asking students to rethink some of their earlier thoughts in light of the service experience. I hope this project gives a clear throughline to the course as a whole; I hope, too, that it conveys to students the nature of learning as cumulative &amp; always needing revision. (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a more elegant way to say that.) Basically: knowledge&mdash;in all its forms&mdash;builds &amp; often requires us to adjust what we previously thought about the world.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve done this service learning project before, this is the first time I&rsquo;m teaching it as a fully integrated component of the course. I&rsquo;m excited to see how it goes.</p>

			 <p>With the start of the fall semester next Monday, I&rsquo;ve already had multiple nightmares about the first day of class. In one, I forgot to print my course syllabi, so I was 20 minutes late to class waiting for them to print; in another, I ate a Tootsie roll that I could not chew &amp; swallow, so I had a wad of Tootsie roll in my mouth the entire class; in a third, the class was so unruly I couldn&rsquo;t even complete calling the roll. I don&rsquo;t feel all that nervous for next week, but maybe I&rsquo;m more nervous than I realize.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest consequence to see that negative language about God is no more apophatic in itself than is affirmative language. The apophatic is the linguistic strategy of somehow showing by means of language that which lies beyond language. It is not done, and it cannot be done, by means of negative utterances alone which are no less bits of ordinarily intelligible human discourse than are affirmations. Our negations, therefore, fail of God as much as do our affirmations.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781952826245">√âtienne Gilson</a> on Bonaventure&rsquo;s understanding of the unity of divine ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the ideas designate divine expressions, not in relation to God Himself, but in relation to things; so a certain multiplicity is introduced not into what they are, or even into what they signify, but into what they connote. It is as though the multiplicity of material things produced by the divine ideas cast a sort of diversifying reflection upon their unity, with the result that we believe by a quite natural illusion that we find already formed in them a plurality which cannot really exist since it implies the presence of matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this articulation of a primordial unity to what is, prior to (yet without denying the reality of) multiplicity in matter.</p>

			 <p>James Baldwin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a sense of the grotesque about a person who has spent his or her life in a kind of cotton batting. There is something monstrous about never having been hurt, never having been made to bleed, never having lost anything, never having gained anything because life is beautiful, and in order to keep it beautiful you&rsquo;re going to stay just the way you are and you&rsquo;re not going to test your theory against all the possibilities outside. America is something like that. The failure on our part to accept the reality of pain, of anguish, of ambiguity, of death has turned us into a very peculiar and sometimes monstrous people. It means, for one thing, and it&rsquo;s very serious, that people who have had no experience have no compassion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This connection between the experience of pain &amp; the possibility of compassion is instructive, I think, especially in how <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781506471730">Anne Carpenter</a> then applies it to Christian tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recognition of a Christian tradition that is capable of immense ugliness&mdash;the recovery of our life&rsquo;s pain, of the pain we have inflicted on others&mdash;is, then, requisite for the rediscovery of Christian compassion, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P%C3%A9guy">P√©guy</a> simply calls &ldquo;charity.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why have we settled for this strange cultural compromise&mdash;lowbrow genres, done with middlebrow earnestness, in pretend revolt against a thoroughly defunded highbrow regime? The answer is simple &amp; depressing. We have accepted the idea of the democratization of culture&mdash;we have accepted, rightly, that, say, opera is not inherently worthier than jazz, that superhero comics are not inherently dumb, that ancient epic poetry is not automatically loftier than rap (with which it shares some features), that all of these things can be done well or badly &amp; that they serve different ends&mdash;without accomplishing <em>democracy</em>. I mean this in a dully straightforward way. We are not all equally in control of our lives, &amp; we are afraid of what becoming so would entail, of the costs of democracy, of the mess of it. We are divided by class, race, &amp; gender &amp; united only in being the objects of a ceaseless corporate effort to accomplish our commodification. Having lost the economic battle to economic &amp; political elites, we celebrate, again &amp; again, our victory over the mostly imaginary cultural elite that would scorn us for watching <em>90 Day Fianc√©</em>. What you can&rsquo;t do practically, you do symbolically, until it becomes a neurosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can say that the mediatory action that tradition &ldquo;is&rdquo;&mdash;the <em>tradere</em> of <em>traditio</em>&mdash;is most properly understood &amp; most properly &ldquo;itself&rdquo; in the present, in the <em>action</em> of Christian existence (in thought, in practice). Tradition, we might say, is alive in the living. Though it is at times characterized as the memory of the dead, its life is to be found in the thinking &amp; practicing of living Christians, a notion that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Blondel">Blondel</a> also stresses. Tradition&rsquo;s value, &amp; what is to be valued in it, is not to be found in its <em>pastness</em>. Its value is what it mediates, is its mediation.</p>
<p>&amp; this mediation of tradition is not unhinged from its past. This is not in other words, the expression of a tyranny of pure contemporaneity. Today is permeable to yesterday, indeed enlivened by yesterday, through human action (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P%C3%A9guy">the poem-plays</a>: the action of prayer). But yesterday only lives on in a specific act of remembering, one where the aliveness of the original is reiterated by being begun again, a beginning-again that infuses the original with new richness.</p>

			 <p>I really enjoyed both <em>Barbie</em> &amp; <em>Oppenheimer</em>; I plan to see both again soon, but some initial thoughts:</p>
<p><em>Barbie</em> is just so fun to watch, start to finish. The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird &amp; funny, &amp; Ryan Gosling &amp; Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances&mdash;Gosling&rsquo;s wonderfully funny, &amp; Robbie&rsquo;s wonderfully subtle. Greta Gerwig adds another film to <a href="https://youtu.be/cNi_HC839Wo">her already impressive</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/uoq3Ro4iGls">body of work</a> in this sensitive &amp; delightful reflection on the human project of making meaning in the face of uncertainty &amp; death.</p>
<p>That this is, apparently, only <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/after-barbie-mattel-is-raiding-its-entire-toybox">the first of Mattel&rsquo;s own cinematic universe</a> makes me more than a little queasy&mdash;&amp; takes some of the bite out <em>Barbie</em>&rsquo;s jokes at Mattel&rsquo;s expsnse&mdash;but I really, really enjoyed <em>Barbie</em> all the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking about <em>Oppenheimer</em>. Like much of Nolan&rsquo;s work it&rsquo;s grand &amp; ambitious, but I worry it stumbles a bit under its own weight. Still, it is buoyed by several strong performances (chief among them Cillian Murphy &amp; Robert Downey, Jr.) &amp; visually &amp; aurally stunning sequences. The nonlinear storytelling, while a staple for Nolan, I think did more to detract from than add to the film&mdash;though it did allow for an extremely powerful final scene. (I don&rsquo;t want to say much more than that, for folks who haven&rsquo;t seen it.) Especially now that I have a better sense of the plot in mind, I&rsquo;ll have to see it strikes me on a second viewing. I wasn&rsquo;t quite disappointed or letdown by the film, but neither did it quite have the impact I was anticipating.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780824522612">James Alison</a>, riffing on Thomas Merton &amp; Ren√© Girard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The staggering thing that this means, for me, is that the most extraordinary fruit of contemplation in the shadow of the violence which we are experiencing is this: God likes us. All of us. God likes me &amp; I like being liked. It has nothing to do with whether we are bad or good, indeed, he takes it for granted that we are all more or less strongly tied up in the sacred lie. In teaching after teaching he makes the same point: all are invited, bad &amp; good. Those are our categories, part of the problem not part of the solution, not God&rsquo;s category. God&rsquo;s &lsquo;category&rsquo; for us is &lsquo;created&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;created&rsquo; means &lsquo;liked spaciously, delighted in, wanted to give extension, fulfilment, fruition to, to share in just being&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This willingness continually to revise one&rsquo;s own location in order to place oneself in the path of beauty is the basic impulse underlying education. One submits oneself to other minds (teachers) in order to increase the chance that one will be looking in the right direction when a comet makes its sweep through a certain patch of sky. The arts and sciences, like Plato&rsquo;s dialogues, have at their center the drive to confer greater clarity on what already has clear discernibility, as well as to confer initial clarity on what originally has none. They are a key mechanism in what Diotima called begetting and what Tocqueville called distribution. By perpetuating beauty, institutions of education help incite the will toward continual creation.</p>

			 <p>Gilson on Bonaventure&rsquo;s translation of Francis&rsquo;s <em>ascesis</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imitation of St. Francis could not be literal imitation as he had to omit the extraordinary asceticism and the extreme macerations practised by him: it had to be rather a translation. And this translation itself was possible only provided that some other discipline should come to fill the place left void, and play the part played in the earlier saint by discipline of the body. And, extraordinary as the thing must then have seemed, why should this new discipline not have been a discipline of the mind? Prayer, of course, meditation, already so wonderfully practised by St. Francis; but why not also a new transmutation of learning into love, a transmutation unknown to the founder of the Order because the ways of learning had not been his?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What St. Francis had simply felt and lived, St. Bonaventure was to <em>think</em>; thanks to the organizing power of his genius, the interior effusions of the Poverello were to be given shape as thought; the personal intuitions of St. Francis were totally detached from science, but they were to work like leaven in the mass of philosophical ideas piled up by Bonaventure in the University of Paris, to act as a principle of selection, eliminating some elements, assimilating others, drawing nourishment from Aristotle as from St. Augustine, yet adapting both to its use wherever it judged necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all the guilt-tripping and scapegoating implicit in the late medieval obsession with human responsibility for the death of Christ, there are optimistic and universalist implications in the understanding that that death is representative. If it is <em>humanitas</em> that suffers, if <em>pars</em> is really <em>totum</em>, then <em>all</em> are in the suffering body lifted to God and <em>all</em> are in every self that joins with, that performs, the <em>humanitas</em> of Christ.</p>

			 <p>How to teach a course on Francis &amp; Clare of Assisi?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis &amp; Clare.‚Äù This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission &amp; values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives &amp; writings of Francis &amp; Clare.</p>
<p>Teaching such a course is not without its challenges. The twenty-first century United States seems worlds apart from thirteenth-century Italy, &amp; we cannot understand Francis &amp; Clare without understanding their world. Francis &amp; Clare are themselves very strange people‚Äîstrange not only for their preference of poverty to riches &amp; asceticism to comfort, but also for their reasons for those preferences. &amp; given the gap that yawns between our day &amp; theirs, it‚Äôs not always immediately clear why people today should care about this pair of strange medieval Christians.</p>
<p>Or, so it would seem. While I do want my teaching to preserve the strangeness of Francis &amp; Clare, lest we domesticate them to the Francis of the birdbath, their lives &amp; situations are not always so remote from our own. Allow me to describe, in broad strokes, my approach in teaching ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis &amp; Clare.‚Äù The course, &amp; my remarks today, unfold across three movements. First, we must pay attention to Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs own context; second, we must pay attention to Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs words &amp; deeds; third, we must pay attention to our own context, words, &amp; deeds.</p>
<h2 id="we-first-pay-attention-to-francis--clares-own-context">We first pay attention to Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs own context.</h2>
<p>We have to begin with the world into which Francis &amp; Clare were born. That world includes some theological ideas that medieval Christians took for granted &amp; that find peculiar expression in Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs lives &amp; writings: ideas like creation, sin, the kingdom of God, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19%3A16-26&amp;version=NRSVCE">the incompatibility of living for God &amp; living for money</a>, the redeeming suffering &amp; death of Jesus, martyrdom &amp; monasticism. But Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs world was not just religious but also economic, social, &amp; cultural, &amp; these factors played as much a role in shaping Francis &amp; Clare as did their religion.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> They witnessed a growing disparity in wealth between the haves &amp; have-nots; they lived through rapid urbanization &amp; a spiritual crisis brought about by this new form of isolated living; they were grieved at the marginalization of the sick &amp; the poor from community life.</p>
<p>Only with some sense of this context can we begin to understand the meaning of Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs words &amp; gestures. In setting this context, too, students can begin to draw connections between Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs world &amp; our own. Wealth &amp; income inequality are not, after all, unfamiliar phenomena to us today; neither is social isolation brought about by new technologies &amp; societal circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="second-we-pay-attention-to-francis--clares-own-words--deeds">Second, we pay attention to Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs own words &amp; deeds,</h2>
<p>especially how these words &amp; deeds respond to their particular historical &amp; cultural moment. We begin by looking at ‚Äòpenance‚Äô, for this is the decisive impulse of Francis‚Äôs life. <a href="https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-testament/140-fa-ed-1-page-124">As he reflects on his life in his <em>Testament</em> Francis narrates his own religious conversion</a> with these words: ‚ÄúThe Lord gave me, Brother Francis, thus to begin doing penance in this way: for when I was in sin, it seemed too bitter for me to see those suffering leprosy. &amp; the Lord himself led me among them, &amp; I showed mercy to them.‚Äù This penitential orientation, which entails rejecting whatever alienates &amp; dehumanizes the human fraternity &amp; instead practicing compassion &amp; mercy for all God‚Äôs creatures, is the defining feature of Francis‚Äôs outlook &amp; behavior.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Here the benefit of knowing Francis‚Äôs context begins to show forth: without understanding how Assisi stigmatized &amp; marginalized those with leprosy, it is impossible to understand with any depth the significance of Francis‚Äôs life of penance.</p>
<p>Poverty is another major theme in this part of the course; here again contextualizing Francis &amp; Clare helps illuminate this supremely countercultural practice.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Francis &amp; Clare refuse to handle money not just out of gospel fidelity or trust in God, but as a gesture responding directly to the violence wrought by an emerging money economy.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Their embrace of poverty is something of a protest: against the ascendancy of the transactional over the personal in human relationship, &amp; against the evaluation of persons (or, more distressingly for Francis &amp; Clare, the de-valuation of persons) based on economic status.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>We consider other themes in Francis &amp; Clare‚Äôs lives &amp; writings, too‚Äîfraternal living &amp; universal kinship,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> peacemaking,<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> prayer &amp; contemplation,<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> to name a few. Students particularly enjoy discussing how Francis &amp; Clare each navigate church authorities, in often unexpectedly subversive ways.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="third-we-pay-attention-to-our-own-context-words--deeds">Third, we pay attention to our own context, words, &amp; deeds.</h2>
<p>The hope here is that students will read the ‚Äúsigns of the times,‚Äù as it were, in light of the lives &amp; values of Francis &amp; Clare. My sections of ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis &amp; Clare‚Äù tend to focus on the moral &amp; spiritual challenge posed by climate change; I have found this issue is rarely far from students‚Äô minds, &amp; Francis &amp; Clare offer some particularly apt resources to engage this issue.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, ideas of fraternity &amp; kinship. What obligations do we humans have to the natural world, if <a href="https://franciscantradition.org/francis-of-assisi-early-documents/the-saint/writings-of-francis/the-canticle-of-the-creatures/129-fa-ed-1-page-113">nonhuman creatures are sister &amp; brother to us as Francis sang</a>? How have humans failed in that obligation, particularly in the wake of the industrial revolution &amp; the widespread environmental degradation of our day? If God is praised through all God‚Äôs creatures, what does the loss of biodiversity mean for creation‚Äôs capacity to reflect the depths of God‚Äôs goodness &amp; beauty? How should human beings who enjoy some degree of privilege respond with mercy &amp; compassion to <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">the cry of the earth &amp; the cry of the poor</a>? We ask these &amp; related questions in light of our study of Francis &amp; Clare.</p>
<p>The goal of ‚ÄúThe Way of Francis &amp; Clare‚Äù is not just to know a little bit about the personalities behind the mission &amp; values of SBU; the goal is also to consider how Francis &amp; Clare continue to speak to people of good will today, urging us to patterns of life that prefer mercy to cruelty, compassion to apathy, generosity to wealth, justice to oppression. Whether they are heard today depends as much on the students as it does the instructor, but if we cannot hear Francis &amp; Clare in their own day we certainly cannot hear them in ours.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781626982666">Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril</a> by Elizabeth A. Johnson üìö</p>
<p>I admire the aim here: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&rsquo;s life, death, &amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp; while I don&rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&rsquo;s life (natal &amp; risen) &amp; his death don&rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.</p>
<p>More frustrating is the hostility toward Anselm of Canterbury &amp; his satisfaction theory. It seems to me Johnson could have attended more carefully to Anselm&rsquo;s method (<em>remoto Christi</em> does not necessarily mean <em>remoto fidei</em>) &amp; the scope of <em>Cur Deus homo</em>; I also think her treatment of satisfaction theory actually reads later theories (especially penal substitutionary atonement) back into Anselm. I&rsquo;m not sure what accounts for this superficial reading; perhaps engaging more up-to-date scholarship could have helped better situate Anselm in his proper context (more Benedictine monastic than feudal).</p>
<p>The treatment of Anselm is disappointing not only because it misrepresents him, but also because I actually think Anselm could be a resource for Johnson&rsquo;s project here. His concerns are not identical to hers, of course&mdash;we wouldn&rsquo;t expect them to be&mdash;but the themes of mercy and cosmic setting-aright are decisive for Anselm. I think a more generous and productive reading of Anselm is possible.</p>

You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.</p>

			 <p>Zena Hitz on <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/the-grace-of-wholeheartedness">reununciation &amp; happiness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feared that if I were not in charge of my happiness, I would not attain it. Such fears were fed by my relative wealth and success. Wealth is dangerous: it provides the illusion of dominance over one‚Äôs surroundings. If I can replace something in my household if I simply don‚Äôt like its looks, if I can order a car and driver whenever my feet are tired, or fly to Rome whenever I crave pasta carbonara, or purchase a warm blanket at the first chill of winter, I develop illusions about myself. Even worse, if I can transform a landscape with my enterprise, whether by building or by destruction, if I have the power of life or death over others, I begin to imagine that I am a sort of being different from what I really am. I begin to imagine myself as a godlike being who makes reality when I open my mouth or raise a single finger. Yet ultimately my control is extremely limited, as Oedipus learned, by the luck of circumstances and by inescapable forms of human ignorance. Wealth can seem to make these contingencies shrink, but they cannot be eliminated. Dependence and blindness are core realities for every human being.</p>

			 <p>Philipp Rosemann:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me draw upon the register of contemporary philosophy to explain: if Heidegger is correct that the key to a thinker&rsquo;s ideas lies in &ldquo;that which, in what is said, remains unsaid&rdquo; (<em>das im Sagen Ungesagte</em>)&mdash;in unarticulated, sometimes even unthought presuppositions underpinning an entire intellectual edifice&mdash;then it may not only be legitimate but crucial to read a work from its margins, from between its lines.</p>

I wish I had read it instead of listening to the audiobook. The audiobook narrator read in a very performative style, almost like it was a stage production, at times even shouting the words. That approach may have suited Yuknavitch&rsquo;s writing style, but I found it consistently distracting and occasionally even irritating.</p>

			 <p>Dorothy Day <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/scandal-works-mercy">on the scandalous character of the works of mercy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The works of mercy are a wonderful stimulus to our growth in faith as well as in love. Our faith is taxed to the utmost and so grows through this strain put upon it. It is pruned again and again, and springs up bearing much fruit. For anyone starting to live literally the words of the Fathers of the Church, ‚Äúthe bread you retain belongs to the hungry, the dress you lock up is the property of the naked,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat is superfluous for one‚Äôs need is to be regarded as plunder if one retains it for one‚Äôs self,‚Äù there is always a trial ahead. ‚ÄúOur faith, more precious than gold, must be tried as though by fire.‚Äù Here is a letter we received today. ‚ÄúI took a gentleman seemingly in need of spiritual and temporal guidance into my home on a Sunday afternoon. Let him have a nap on my bed, went through the want ads with him, made coffee and sandwiches for him, and when he left, I found my wallet had gone also.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her words call to mind, for me, the words attributed to St. Vincent de Paul (I have not been able to verify whether they are indeed his):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will find out that Charity is a heavy burden to carry, heavier than the kettle of soup and the full basket. But you will keep your gentleness and your smile. It is not enough to give soup and bread. This the rich can do. You are the servant of the poor, always smiling and good-humored. They are your masters, terribly sensitive and exacting master you will see and the uglier and the dirtier they will be, the more unjust and insulting, the more love you must give them. It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is one of my favorite exchanges in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780061947353">C. S. Lewis&rsquo;s <em>The Great Divorce</em></a>. Here the &ldquo;Big Man&rdquo; (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life&mdash;ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven&mdash;&amp; how Heaven is therefore his &ldquo;by rights.&rdquo; Len (his guide to Heaven &amp; apparently a former employee of the Big Man&rsquo;s) keeps trying to dissuade him from thinking about Heaven as a matter of deserts.</p>
<p>This is something I encounter, semester after semester, in my students‚Äô thinking about Heaven &amp; Hell: it must be a matter of what one deserves. But as Len himself notes, no one in Heaven gets what they deserve: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad as that. I haven&rsquo;t got my rights, or I should not be here. You will not get yours either. You&rsquo;ll get something far better. Never fear.&rdquo; No one is really good enough to actually <em>deserve</em> the joys of Heaven; this is not so much a comment on the smallness of human goodness as a comment on the largeness of Heaven&rsquo;s joys.</p>
<p>If Heaven is a matter of being eternally enfolded into the love of God&mdash;into the love that <em>is</em> God&mdash;then it cannot be the case that Heaven is a matter of just deserts. That&rsquo;s not only because humans have a self-destructive tendency to turn from love when they encounter it (Len again: &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t a decent man and you didn&rsquo;t do your best. We none of us were and none of us did. Lord bless you, it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;), but also because <em>that&rsquo;s not how love works</em>. Love is not something earned or merited: it is a gift, freely given &amp; gratefully received.</p>
<p>To think about Heaven as something someone earns&mdash;as a reward for good behavior&mdash;is to go about it all wrong. But if we think about Heaven instead as God&rsquo;s offer of self in love, well, now we&rsquo;re on to something.</p>

			 <p>I love this move Pope Francis makes in his interpretation of the parable of the good Samaritan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus asks us to be present to those in need of help, regardless of whether or not they belong to our social group. In this case, the Samaritan¬†<em>became a neighbour</em>¬†to the wounded Judean. By approaching and making himself present, he crossed all cultural and historical barriers. Jesus concludes the parable by saying: ‚ÄúGo and do likewise‚Äù (<em>Lk</em>¬†10:37). In other words, he challenges us to put aside all differences and, in the face of suffering, to draw near to others with no questions asked. I should no longer say that I have neighbours to help, but that I must myself be a neighbour to others.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780567077592">Walter Kasper</a> on kingdom of God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when the ultimate source of all reality, God&rsquo;s love, re-establishes itself and comes to power, the world is restored to order and salvation. Because each individual can feel himself accepted and approved without reserve, he becomes free to live with others. The coming of the Kingdom of God&rsquo;s love therefore means the salvation of the world as a whole and the salvation of every individual. Everyone can now know that love is the ultimate, that it is stronger than death, stronger than hatred and injustice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people in whom Jesus realized the kingdom of God&mdash;in his preaching &amp; in his miracles&mdash;experienced the kingdom of God as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+9%3A1-8&amp;version=RSVCE">a forgiveness of sins</a>, that is to say, as an encounter with God&rsquo;s abundant, indeed unlimited, mercy. To be forgiven of one&rsquo;s sins is to know oneself to be loved. God&rsquo;s love, in other words, knows no limits and is available even to those considered religiously undesirable: sinners &amp; taxcollectors, lepers &amp; gentiles.</p>
<p>This experience of an unconditioned love is an experience of freedom. To know that you are loved beyond measure &amp; apart from any merit frees you to love of others&mdash;if you are loved by a love made available through the life &amp; death of Jesus to even the worst among sinners (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A15&amp;version=RSVCE">1 Timothy 1:15</a>), then there is no reason not to love your neighbors. There is no need for egoism or worldly striving, for self-interest or status; there is no need to convince yourself that you are loved for your accomplishments or achievements. You are loved, even apart from all that. Resting in the assurance of God&rsquo;s love, then, one can stop trying to convince others (&amp; yourself) that you are lovable. To know oneself to be loved is to be freed from worrying about oneself so that one can <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2019/05/18/that-attention-is.html">turn one&rsquo;s attention</a> to others.</p>
<p>But this individual experience of love has effects not only on the individual or an individual&rsquo;s interpersonal relationships. It brings about a new order to society: rather than the status quo of getting ahead, of making money, of winning status &amp; privilege (&amp; consequently reducing the status &amp; privilege of others), a society that is built upon love for all can be a society that seeks the good of all. You can make a new start at your life, focused not on self-aggrandizement but on the flourishing of another (&amp; yourself).</p>
<p>How does all this justify the claim that love is stronger even than death? Elsewhere Kasper writes that &ldquo;love, as it were, entraps evil and by doing so it overcomes it and creates the possibility of a new start.&rdquo; I think that&rsquo;s relevant here. To respond to evil with love, to cruelty with kindness, to violence with peace, forecloses the possibility of evil. The evil-doer&mdash;the enemy&mdash;can keep doing evil, of course. Often they do. But in refusing to respond in kind, the Christian puts a stop to evil. The enemy no longer is enemy; evil no longer saps the good of its goodness. When Jesus is unjustly put to death &amp; refuses to respond in kind, the Father vindicates Jesus&rsquo;s love even unto death by raising him on the third day. Love has the final say; love restores the world to order.</p>
<p>Every time I try to talk about this&mdash;Jesus&rsquo;s message of love as the answer to evil &amp; death&mdash;with my students, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that this message of love is so cringe or corny or clich√© (like the little speech John Mayer spliced into the middle of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65hqZpwJAbI">his otherwise impeccable performance of &ldquo;Bold as Love&rdquo;</a>). Really? Love? It just seems so obviously inadequate. But that reaction is because we&mdash;&amp; here I mean my students as well as myself&mdash;don&rsquo;t fully grasp how radical this message of love really is. It cuts so deeply against the foundations of society that we have a hard time making sense of it; we have to attenuate it beyond recognition so that it stands as only faint shadow of what Jesus meant when he spoke of the love of his <em>abba</em>. After all, Jesus&rsquo;s love led him to Golgotha, just as the love of the martyrs since Jesus&mdash;Perpetua &amp; Felicity, Joan of Arc, Martin Luther King Jr., √ìscar Romero, &amp; countless others whose names we don&rsquo;t know&mdash;have likewise lead to their deaths. Yet it is in their dying that the ultimate meaning of love &amp; its victory is revealed.</p>

			 <p>Interesting series on apophatic &amp; cataphatic theology over at Theopolis. <a href="https://theopolisinstitute.com/conversations/the-eclipse-of-the-word-five-theses-on-apophaticism/">Timothy Troutner suggests</a> a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; apophaticism (represented especially in so-called grammatical thomists like McCabe &amp; in post-Heidegerrean philosophers like Marion) endangers the possibility of revelation &amp; christology. I find myself more sympathetic to <a href="https://theopolisinstitute.com/conversations/fear-desire-and-perplexity">Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt&rsquo;s response</a> (not exactly a disagreement with Troutner, though certainly a defense of McCabe&rsquo;s grammatical thomism), but I&rsquo;ll have to think more carefully about Troutner&rsquo;s concerns, especially since I myself am inclined to the sort of apophaticism grammatical thomism represents.</p>

			 <p>Walter Kasper on theodicy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the terrible experiences of the twentieth century the question arises unavoidably: How can God stand by and watch all this? How could he allow it? There is no easy answer to this question. Like Job we can only keep silence (cf. Job 42). The christology of the Church Fathers shows the direction in which to look for a possible answer. It starts from the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Philippians. There Paul speaks of <em>kenosis</em>, that is, the self-emptying of one who was in the form of God (Phil. 2.5&ndash;11). On the basis of this saying, the Church Fathers developed their <em>kenosis</em> christology. It says: God did not just stand by and watch human misery. He does not sit motionlessly enthroned over a world full of horror. He himself also became involved in humiliation, suffering and death, even unjust death, in order to be near us in such extreme situations, so that where all hope is lost he can give us hope and a share in his divine life.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/04/09/a-few-things.html">A Few Things You Would Read If You Wanted to Figure Out What I Get Out of Christianity</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/04/09/a-few-things.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-04-10 13:54:53 -0500">Apr 10, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Inspired by <a href="https://philipchristman.substack.com/p/a-few-things-you-would-read-if-you">Phil Christman&rsquo;s recent post of the same name</a>, here&rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what <em>I</em> get out of Christianity.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Christman&rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It‚Äôs extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone‚Äôs. It reflects where I sit in a set of social structures. Either God came and met me there, despite the badness of those structures, or God didn‚Äôt, but if God did, this was how, or part of it. Either way, I make no apology. It‚Äôs my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an effort to limit myself, I&rsquo;m going to try to copy Christman&rsquo;s basic form: he includes a literary classic, a work from a spiritual writer, an essay, &amp; a classic in Christian apologetics. I, not Christman, have identified these categories, &amp; I realize his list could have been categorized differently. But this keeps things manageable for me, at least for now.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250082244"><em>Silence: A Novel</em>, by Sh≈´saku End≈ç</a>. What is it to be a Christian in the face of suffering, both your own &amp; another&rsquo;s? What is it to be a Christian when all you hear is God&rsquo;s silence? These are the questions that occupy this book. Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s film adaptation is excellent, too, though no substitute for the book. (Honestly, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812974263"><em>Les Mis√©rables</em></a> probably better belongs in this category of &ldquo;literary classic&rdquo;&mdash;its treatment of themes of justice &amp; mercy in the personal &amp; social lives of Christians has had a deep effect on me, though I can hardly recommend a 650,000+ word novel on a list like this.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307589521"><em>Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</em>, by Thomas Merton</a>. Most anything by Thomas Merton could fit into this spot, but I&rsquo;ve chosen <em>Conjectures</em> because I think it shows how Merton weds the contemplative &amp; the active especially later in his life. He wanders a bit in this book &amp; that can make it difficult to follow where he&rsquo;s going, but it&rsquo;s nevertheless a rewarding read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He Was Crucified, Suffered Death, and Was Buried&rdquo; (collected in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780826461919"><em>God Still Matters</em></a>) by Herbert McCabe. This essay, I think, best presents the pithy line <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching">Terry Eagleton attributed</a> to McCabe: &ldquo;If you don‚Äôt love you‚Äôre dead, and if you do, they‚Äôll kill you.&rdquo; (Come to think of it, that Eagleton essay could fit well into this slot, too.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781467459259"><em>The Love That Is God: An Invitation to Christian Faith</em>, by Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt</a>. It may be a bit premature to call this one a classic&mdash;though it is very, very good, &amp; destined to be a classic according to Sarah Coakley&rsquo;s foreword&mdash;&amp; the book isn&rsquo;t exactly an apologetic, but it fits well enough into this category. Fritz&mdash;who, full disclosure, directed my master&rsquo;s thesis while I was a graduate student at Loyola University Maryland&mdash;has left an impression on me that goes deeper than I think he realizes. <em>The Love That Is God</em> basically summarizes what I would want anyone to know about Christianity, &amp; so I feel it belongs in this spot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to&mdash;&amp; I think I will&mdash;revisit this list &amp; revise it in the future. (My <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2023/04/09/phil-christman-a.html">initial post on this idea</a> names a few others writers whom I&rsquo;d like to include, especially Dorothy Day.) I might swap out certain entries, I might add more categories to consider, or I might overhaul it entirely. But that, at least for the moment, is what I&rsquo;d suggest you read if you want to figure out what I get out of Christianity.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m not sure whether this is behind a paywall but Phil Christman&rsquo;s writing is well worth the $10 a month it costs.)</p>
<p>This is a cool idea; I might try to come up with my own list. Off the top of my head I&rsquo;d have to include Sh≈´saku End≈ç&rsquo;s <em>Silence</em>, probably <em>Les Mis√©rables</em>, &amp; something by Thomas Merton (<em>Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</em> or <em>New Seeds of Contemplation</em>). Dorothy Day should be on here, too, &amp; at least an essay by Herbert McCabe. There&rsquo;d probably be a lot of overlap with <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/2022/05/30/yesterday-i-saw.html">my personal canon</a>, but that&rsquo;s all right.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Colleges Should Be More Than Just Vocational Schools.&rdquo; Bret C. Devereaux. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/opinion/humanities-liberal-arts-policy-higher-education.html">nytimes.com</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But this is a grim and narrow view of the purpose of higher education, merely as a tool to train workers as replaceable cogs in America‚Äôs economic machine, to generate raw material for its largest companies. Higher education, with broad study in the liberal arts, is meant to create not merely good workers but good citizens. Citizens with knowledge of their history and culture are better equipped to lead and participate in a democratic society; learning in many different forms of knowledge teaches the humility necessary to accept other points of view in a pluralistic and increasingly globalized society.</p>

			 <p>√ìscar Romero:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a sorry lot are those Christians who think that their religion is a museum of memories; their only desire is to preserve the memories and not expose themselves to danger. No, sisters and brothers, the church is communion and life; she is communion of life, and her members must confront life in real time. That is life. The church&rsquo;s laws, dogmas, and beliefs must be transformed into life. Those who don&rsquo;t want to understand the church this way are not worshiping the eternal living One, Christ, who will never die. We worship a living God who walks alongside the people, the God who tells us not to commit injustices because if the poor victims of usurers and loan sharks &ldquo;cry out to heaven, I will hear them, for I am the living God&rdquo; (Exod. 22:27).</p>
